### *Chapter 30* 

# The Broken Binding

THE SIGN OVER THE doorpost read: THE BROKEN BINDING. I took it to be an auspicious sign and walked in.

A woman sat behind a desk. I assumed she was the owner. She was tall and reedy with thinning hair. She looked up from a ledger, her expression vaguely irritated.

Deciding to keep niceties to a minimum, I walked to her desk and handed her the book. “How much would you give me for this?”

She leafed through it professionally, feeling the paper between her fingers, checking the binding. She shrugged. “A couple of jots.”

“It’s worth more than that!” I said indignantly.

“It’s worth what you can get for it,” she said matter-of-factly. “I’ll give you one and a half.”

“Two talents and I have the option to buy it back for a month.”

She gave a short, barking laugh. “This is not a pawn shop.” She slid the book across the desk toward me with one hand as she picked up her pen with the other.

“Twenty days?”

She hesitated, then gave the book another cursory once-over and brought out her purse. She pulled out two heavy silver talents. It was more money than I’d seen in one place for a long, long time.

She slid them across the desk. I restrained the desire to snatch them up immediately and said, “I’ll need a receipt.”

This time she gave me such a long hard look that I began to get a little nervous. It was only then I realized how I must look, covered in a year’s worth of alley dirt, trying to get a receipt for a book I’d obviously stolen.

Eventually she gave another bland shrug and scratched out a note on a slip of paper. At the bottom of it she drew a line and made a motion with her pen. “Sign here.”

I looked at the paper. It read:

I, by signing below, hereby attest to the fact that I can neither read nor write.

I looked up at the owner. She held a straight face. I dipped the pen and carefully wrote the letters “D D” as if they were initials.

She fanned the ink dry and slid my “receipt” across the desk toward me. “What does D stand for?” she asked with the barest hint of a smile.

“Defeasance,” I said. “It means to render something null and void, usually a contract. The second D is for Decrepitate. Which is the act of throwing someone into a fire.” She gave me a blank look. “Decrepication is the punishment for forgery in Junpui. I think false receipts fall in that category.”

I made no move to touch the money or the receipt. There was a tense silence.

“This isn’t Junpui,” she said, her face carefully composed .

“True enough,” I admitted. “You have a keen sense of defalcation. Perhaps I should add a third D.”

She gave another sharp, barking laugh and smiled. “You’ve convinced me, young miss.” She pulled out a fresh slip of paper and set it in front of me. “You write me a receipt, and I will sign it.”

I took up the pen and wrote. “I the undersigned, do agree to return the copy of the book Rhetoric and Logic with the inscription “to Kvoan” to the bearer of this note in exchange for two silver pennies, provided she present this receipt before the date-”

I looked up. “What day is it?”

“Shuden. The thirty-fifth.”

I had fallen out of the habit of keeping track of the date. On the streets, one day is largely the same as the next, save that people are a little more drunk on Hepten, a little more generous on Mourning.

But if it was the thirty-fifth then I only had five days to get to the University. I knew from Bean that admissions only lasted until Cendling. If I missed them, I would have to wait two months for the next term to start.

I filled in the date on the receipt and drew a line for the bookseller to sign. She looked a little bemused as I slid the paper toward her. What’s more, she didn’t notice that the receipt read pennies instead of talents. Talents were worth significantly more. This meant she had just agreed to give me back the book for less money than she had bought it for.

My satisfaction damped itself when it occurred to me how foolish all of this was. Pennies or talents, I wouldn’t have enough money to buy the book back in two span. If everything went well I wouldn’t even be in Tarbean tomorrow.

Despite its uselessness, the receipt helped ease the sting of parting with the last thing I owned from my childhood. I blew on the paper, folded it carefully into a pocket, and collected my two silver talents. I was surprised when the woman held out her hand to me.

She smiled in an apologetic way. “Sorry about the note. But you didn’t look like you’d be coming back.” She gave a little shrug. “Here.” She pressed a copper jot into my hand.

I decided that she was not an altogether bad person. I smiled back at her and for a second I almost felt guilty about how I’d written the receipt.

I also felt guilty about the three pens I’d stolen, but only for a second. And since there was no convenient way to give them back, I stole a bottle of ink before I left.
