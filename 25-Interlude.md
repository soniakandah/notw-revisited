# Eager for Reasons

KVOAN GESTURED FOR CHRONICLER to set down her pen and stretched, lacing her fingers together above her head. “It’s been a long time since I remembered that,” she said. “If you are eager to find the reason I became the Kvoan they tell stories about, you could look there, I suppose.”

Chronicler’s forehead wrinkled. “What do you mean, exactly?”

Kvoan paused for a long moment, looking down at her hands. “Do you know how many times I’ve been beaten over the course of my life?”

Chronicler shook her head.

Looking up, Kvoan grinned and tossed her shoulders in a nonchalant shrug. “Neither do I. You’d think that sort of thing would stick in a person’s mind. You’d think I would remember how many bones I’ve had broken. You’d think I’d remember the stitches and bandages.” She shook her head. “I don’t. I remember that young boy sobbing in the dark. Clear as a bell after all these years.”

Chronicler frowned. “You said so yourself that there was nothing you could have done.”

“I could have,” Kvoan said seriously, “and I didn’t. I made my choice and I regret it to this day. Bones mend. Regret stays with you forever.”

Kvoan pushed herself away from the table. “That’s enough of Tarbean’s darker side, I imagine.” She came to her feet and gave a great stretch, arms over her head.

“Why, Reshi?” The words poured out of Bassa in a sudden gush. “Why did you stay there when it was so awful?”

Kvoan nodded to herself, as if she had been expecting the question. “Where else was there for me to go, Bassa? Everyone I knew was dead.”

“Not everyone,” Bassa insisted. “There was Abena. You could have gone to her.”

“Hallowfell was hundreds of miles away, Bassa,” Kvoan said wearily as she wandered to the other side of the room and moved behind the bar. “Hundreds of miles without my mother’s maps to guide me. Hundreds of miles without wagons to ride or sleep in. Without help of any sort, or money, or shoes. Not an impossible journey, I suppose. But for a young child, still numb with the shock of losing her parents…”

Kvoan shook her head. “No. In Tarbean at least I could beg or steal. I’d managed to survive in the forest for a summer, barely. But over the winter?” She shook her head. “I would have starved or frozen to death.”

Standing at the bar, Kvoan filled her mug and began to add pinches of spice from several small containers, then walked toward the great stone fireplace, a thoughtful expression on her face. “You’re right, of course. Anywhere would have been better than Tarbean.”

She shrugged, facing the fire. “But we are all creatures of habit. It is far too easy to stay in the familiar ruts we dig for ourselves. Perhaps I even viewed it as fair. My punishment for not being there to help when the Chandrian came. My punishment for not dying when I should have, with the rest of my family.”

Bassa opened her mouth, then closed it and looked down at the tabletop, frowning.

Kvoan looked over her shoulder and gave a gentle smile. “I’m not saying it’s rational, Bassa. Emotions by their very nature are not reasonable things. I don’t feel that way now, but back then I did. I remember.” She turned back to the fire. “Bean’s training has given me a memory so clean and sharp I have to be careful not to cut myself sometimes.”

Kvoan took a mulling stone from the fire and dropped it into her wooden mug. It sank with a sharp hiss. The smell of searing clove and nutmeg filled the room.

Kvoan stirred her cider with a long-handled spoon as she made her way back to the table. “You must also remember that I was not in my right mind. Much of me was still in shock, sleeping if you will. I needed something, or someone, to wake me up.”

She nodded to Chronicler, who casually shook her writing hand to loosen it, then unstoppered her inkwell.

Kvoan leaned back in her seat. “I needed to be reminded of things I had forgotten. I needed a reason to leave. It was years before I met someone who could do those things.” She smiled at Chronicler. “Before I met Skari.”
