### *Chapter 11*

# The Binding of Iron

I SAT IN THE back of Abena’s wagon. It was a wonderful place for me, home to a hundred bottles and bundles, saturated with a thousand smells. To my young mind it was usually more fun than a tinker’s cart, but not today.

It had rained heavily the night before, and the road was a thick morass of mud. Since the troupe was not on any particular schedule, we had decided to wait for a day or two to give the roads time to dry. It was a fairly common occurrence, and it happened to fall at the perfect time for Bean to further my education. So I sat at the wooden worktable in the back of Bean’s wagon and chafed at wasting the day listening to her lecture me about things I already understood.

My thoughts must have been apparent, because Abena sighed and sat down beside me. “Not quite what you expected, eh?”

I relaxed a bit, knowing her tone meant a temporary reprieve from the lecture. She gathered up a handful of the iron drabs that were sitting on the table and clinked them together thoughtfully in her hand.

She looked at me. “Did you learn to juggle all at once? Five balls at a time? Knives too?”

I flushed a bit at the memory. Trip hadn’t even let me try three balls at first. He’d made me juggle two. I’d even dropped them a couple of times. I told Bean so.

“Right,” Bean said. “Master this trick and you get to learn another.” I expected her to stand up and start back into the lesson, but she didn’t.

Instead she held out the handful of iron drabs. “What do you know about these?” She clattered them together in her hand.

“In what respect?” I asked. “Physically, chemically, historically-”

“Historically,” she grinned, “Astound me with your grasp of historical minutiae, E’lir.” I had asked her what E’lir meant once. She claimed it meant “wise one,” but I had my doubts from the way her mouth had quirked when she said it.

“A long time ago, the people who-”

“How long ago?”

I frowned at her in mock severity. “Roughly two thousand years ago. The nomadic folk who roamed the foothills around the Shalda Mountains were brought together under one chieftain.”

“What was her name?”

“Heldre. Her children were Heldi and Heldar. Would you like her entire lineage, or should I get to the point?” I glowered at her.

“Sorry, miss.” Bean sat up straight in her seat and assumed such an aspect of rapt attention that we both broke into grins.

I started again. “Heldre eventually controlled the foothills around the Shalda. This meant that she controlled the mountains themselves. They started to plant crops, their nomadic lifestyle was abandoned, and they slowly began to-”

“Get to the point?” Abena asked. She tossed the drabs onto the table in front of me.

I ignored her as best I could. “They controlled the only plentiful and easily accessible source of metal for a great distance and soon they were the most skilled workers of those metals as well. They exploited this advantage and gained a great deal of wealth and power.

“Until this point, barter was the most common method of trade. Some larger cities coined their own currency, but outside those cities the money was only worth the weight of the metal. Bars of metal were better for bartering, but full bars of metal were inconvenient to carry.”

Bean gave me her best bored-student face. The effect was only slightly inhibited by the fact that she had burned her eyebrows off again about two days ago. “You’re not going to go into the merits of representational currency, are you?”

I took a deep breath and resolved not to pester Bean so much when she was lecturing me. “The no-longer-nomads, called the Cealdim by now, were the first to establish a standardized currency. By cutting one of these smaller bars into five pieces you get five drabs.” I began to piece two rows of five drabs each together to illustrate my point. They resembled little ingots of metal. “Ten drabs are the same as a copper jot; ten jots-”

“Good enough,” Bean broke in, startling me. “So these two drabs,” she held a pair out for my inspection, “Could have come from the same bar, right?”

“Actually, they probably cast them individually…” I trailed off under a glare. “Sure.”

“So there’s something still connecting them,right?” She gave me the look again.

I didn’t really agree, but knew better than to interrupt. “Right.”

She set them both on the table. “So when you move one, the other should move, right?”

I agreed for the sake of argument, then reached out to move one. But Bean stopped my hand, shaking her head. “You’ve got to remind them first. You’ve got to convince them, in fact.”

She brought out a bowl and decanted a slow blob of pine pitch into it. She dipped one of the drabs into the pitch and stuck the other one to it, spoke several words I didn’t recognize, and slowly pulled the bits apart, strands of pitch stretching between them.

She set one on the table, keeping the other in her hand. Then she muttered something else and relaxed.

She raised her hand, and the drab on the table mimicked the motion. She danced her hand around and the brown piece of iron bobbed in the air.

She looked from me to the coin. “The law of sympathy is one of the most basic parts of magic. It states that the more similar two objects are, the greater the sympathetic link. The greater the link, the more easily they influence each other.”

“Your definition is circular.”

She set down the coin. Her lecturer’s facade gave way to a grin as she tried with marginal success to wipe the pitch off of her hands with a rag. She thought for a while. “Seems pretty useless doesn’t it?”

I gave a hesitant nod, trick questions were fairly common around lesson time.

“Would you rather learn how to call the wind?” Her eyes danced at me. She murmured a word and the canvas ceiling of the wagon rustled around us.

I felt a grin capture my face, wolfish.

“Too bad, E’lir.” Her grin was wolfish too, and savage. “You need to learn your letters before you can write. You need to learn the fingerings on the strings before you play and sing.”

She pulled out a piece of paper and jotted a couple of words on it. “The trick is in holding the Alar firm in your mind. You need to believe they are connected. You need to know they are.” She handed me the paper. “Here is the phonetic pronunciation. It’s called The Sympathetic Binding of Parallel Motion. Practice.” She looked even more lupine than before, old and grizzled with no eyebrows.

She left to wash her hands. I cleared my mind using Heart of Stone. Soon I was floating on a sea of dispassionate calm. I stuck the two bits of metal together with pine pitch. I fixed in my mind the Alar, the riding-crop belief, that the two drabs were connected. I said the words, pulled the coins apart, spoke the last word, and waited.

No rush of power. No flash of hot or cold. No radiant beam of light struck me.

I was rather disappointed . At least as disappointed as I could be in the Heart of Stone. I lifted the coin in my hand, and the coin on the table lifted itself in a similar fashion. It was magic, there was no doubt about that. But I felt rather underwhelmed. I had been expecting…I don’t know what I’d been expecting. It wasn’t this.

The rest of that day was spent experimenting with the simple sympathetic binding Abena had taught me. I learned that almost anything could be bound together. An iron drab and a silver talent, a stone and a piece of fruit, two bricks, a clod of earth and one of the donkeys. It took me about two hours to figure out that the pine pitch wasn’t necessary. When I asked her, Bean admitted that it was merely an aid for concentration. She seemed glad that I figured it out without being told.

Over the course of the next few lessons, Abena provided me with a strong understanding of Sympathy. 

First, energy cannot be created or destroyed. When you are lifting one drab and the other rises off the table, the one in your hand feels as heavy as if you’re lifting both, because, in fact, you are.

That’s in theory. In practice, it feels like you’re lifting three drabs. No sympathetic link is perfect. The more dissimilar the items, the more energy is lost. Like a leaky aqueduct leading to a water wheel. A good sympathetic link has very few leaks, and most of the energy is used. A bad link is full of holes; very little of the effort you put into it goes toward what you want it to do.

I saw this first-hand when I tried linking a piece of chalk to a glass bottle of water. There was very little similarity between the two, so even though the bottle of water might have weighed two pounds, when I tried to lift the chalk it felt like sixty pounds. The best link I found was a tree branch I had broken in half.

After I understood this little piece of sympathy, Bean taught me others. A dozen dozen sympathetic bindings. A hundred little tricks for channeling power. Each of them was a different word in a vast vocabulary I was just beginning to speak. Quite often it was tedious, and I’m not even telling you the half of it.

Bean continued giving me a smattering of lessons in other areas: history, arithmetic, and chemistry. But I grabbed at whatever she could teach me about sympathy. She doled out her secrets sparingly, making me prove I’d mastered one before giving me another. I couldn’t get through her lessons fast enough. 

And yet, the same curiosity that made me such an eager student also led me into trouble with fair regularity.

One evening as I was building up my parent’s cookfire, my father caught me chanting a rhyme I had heard the day before. Not knowing that he was behind me, he overheard as I knocked one stick of firewood against another and absentmindedly recited:

“Seven things has Lady Lackless
Keeps them underneath her black dress
One a ring that’s not for wearing
One a sharp word, not for swearing

Right beside her husband’s candle
There’s a door without a handle
In a box, no lid or locks
Lackless keeps her husband’s rocks

There’s a secret she’s been keeping
She’s been dreaming and not sleeping
On a road, that’s not for traveling
Lackless likes her riddle raveling.”

I had heard a little boy chant it as he played hop-skip. I’d only heard it twice, but it had stuck in my head. It was memorable, as most child rhymes are.

But my father heard me and came over to stand by the fire. “What were you just saying, sweet?” His tone wasn’t angry, but I could tell he wasn’t pleased either.

“Something I heard back in Fallows,” I said evasively. Running off with town children was a largely forbidden activity. Distrust turns quickly to dislike, my mother told new members of our troupe, so stay together when you’re in town, and be polite. I laid some heavier sticks on the fire and let the flames lick them.

My father was silent for a while, and I was beginning to hope he would leave it alone, when he said, “It’s not a nice thing to be singing. Have you stopped to think what it’s about?”

I hadn’t, actually. It seemed mostly nonsense rhyme. But when I ran it back through my head, I saw the rather obvious sexual innuendo. “I’m starting to get it now. I didn’t think about it before.”

His expression grew a little gentler, and he reached down to smooth my hair, “Always think about what you’re singing, honey.”

I seemed to be out of trouble, but I couldn’t keep from asking, “How is it any different than parts of For All His Waiting? Like when Fain asks Lady Perial about her hat? ‘I heard about it from so many men I wished to see it for myself and try the fit.’ It’s pretty obvious what he’s really talking about.”

I watched his mouth grow firm, not angry, but not pleased. Then something in his face changed. “You tell me what the difference is,” he said.

I hated bait questions. The difference was obvious: one would get me in trouble, the other wouldn’t. I waited a while to make it clear I had given the matter proper consideration before I shook my head.

My father knelt lightly in front of the fire, warming his hands. “The difference is…go fetch me the tripod, would you?” He gave me a gentle push, and I scampered off to get it from the back of our wagon as he continued, “The difference is between saying something to a person, and saying something about a person. The first might be rude, but the second is always gossip.”

I brought the tripod back and helped him set it over the fire. “Lady Perial is just a character. Lady Lackless is a real person, with feelings that can be hurt.” He looked up at me.

“I didn’t know,” I protested guiltily.

I must have struck a sufficiently piteous figure because he gathered me in for a hug and a kiss, “It’s nothing to cry over, sweet one. Just remember to always think about what you’re doing.” He ran his hand over my head and smiled like the sun. “I imagine you could make it up to both Lady Lackless and myself if you found some sweet nettle for the pot tonight.”

Any excuse to escape judgment and play for a while in the tangle of trees by the roadside was good enough for me. I was gone almost before the words left his mouth.

I should also make it clear that much of the time I spent with Bean was my free time. I was still responsible for my normal duties in the troupe. I acted the part of the young page when needed. I helped paint scenery and sew costumes. I rubbed down the horses at night and rattled the sheet of tin backstage when we needed thunder onstage.

But I didn’t bemoan the loss of my free time. A child’s endless energy and my own insatiable lust for knowledge made the following year one of the happiest times I can remember.
