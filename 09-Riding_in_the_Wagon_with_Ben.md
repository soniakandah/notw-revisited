# Riding in the Wagon with Bean

ABENA WAS THE FIRST arcanist I ever met, a strange, exciting figure to a young girl. She was knowledgeable in all the sciences: botany, astronomy, psychology, anatomy, alchemy, geology, chemistry…

She was portly, with twinkling eyes that moved quickly from one thing to another. She had short, dark grey hair curling around her ears, but (and this is what I remember most about her) no eyebrows. Rather, she had them, but they were in a perpetual state of regrowing from being burned off in the course of her alchemical pursuits. It made her look surprised and quizzical all at once.

She spoke gently, laughed often, and never exercised her wit at the expense of others. She cursed like a drunken sailor with a broken leg, but only at her donkeys. They were called Alpha and Beta, and Abena fed them carrots and lumps of sugar when she thought no one was looking. Chemistry was her particular love, and my mother said she’d never known a woman to run a better still.

By her second day in our troupe I was making a habit of riding in her wagon. I would ask her questions and she would answer. Then she would ask for songs and I would pluck them out for her on a lute I borrowed from my mother’s wagon.

She would even sing from time to time. She had a bright, reckless voice that was always wandering off, looking for notes in the wrong places. More often than not she stopped and laughed at herself when it happened. She was a good woman, and there was no conceit in her.

Not long after she joined our troupe, I asked Abena what it was like being an arcanist.

She gave me a thoughtful look. “Have you ever known an arcanist?”

“We paid one to mend a cracked axle on the road once.” I paused to think. “He was heading inland with a caravan of fish.”

Abena made a dismissive gesture. “No, no, girl. I’m talking about arcanists. Not some poor chill-charmer who works their way back and forth across caravan routes, trying to keep fresh meat from rotting.”

“What’s the difference?” I asked, sensing it was expected of me.

“Well,” she said. “That might take a bit of explaining…”

“I’ve got nothing but time.”

Abena gave me an appraising look. I’d been waiting for it. It was the look that said, “You don’t sound as young as you look.” I hoped she’d come to grips with it fairly soon. It gets tiresome being spoken to as if you are a child, even if you happen to be one.

She took a deep breath. “Just because someone knows a trick or two doesn’t mean they’re an arcanist. They might know how to set a bone or read Eld Vintic. Maybe they even know a little sympathy. But-”

“Sympathy?” I interrupted as politely as possible.

“You’d probably call it magic,” Abena said reluctantly. “It’s not, really.” She shrugged. “But even knowing sympathy doesn’t make you an arcanist. A true arcanist has worked their way through the Arcanum at the University.”

At her mention of the Arcanum, I bristled with two dozen new questions. Not so many, you might think, but when you added them to the half-hundred questions I carried with me wherever I went, I was stretched nearly to bursting. Only through a severe effort of will did I remain silent, waiting for Abena to continue on her own.

Abena, however, noticed my reaction. “So, you’ve heard about the Arcanum, have you?” She seemed amused. “Tell me what you’ve heard, then.”

This small prompt was all the excuse I needed. “I heard from a girl in Temper Glen that if your arm’s cut off they can sew it back on at the University. Can they really? Some stories say Taborlin the Great went there to learn the names of all things. There’s a library with a thousand books. Are there really that many?”

She answered the last question, the others having rushed by too quickly for her to respond. “More than a thousand, actually. Ten times ten thousand books. More than that. More books than you could ever read.” Abena’s voice grew vaguely wistful.

More books than I could read? Somehow I doubted that.

Abena continued. “The people you see riding with caravans-charmers who keep food from spoiling, dowsers, fortune-tellers, toad eaters-aren’t real arcanists any more than all traveling performers are Edema Ruh. They might know a little alchemy, a little sympathy, a little medicine.” She shook her head. “But they’re not arcanists.

“A lot of people pretend to be. They wear robes and put on airs to take advantage of the ignorant and gullible. But here’s how you tell a true arcanist.”

Abena pulled a fine chain over her head and handed it to me. It was the first time I had ever seen an Arcanum guilder. It looked rather unimpressive, just a flat piece of lead with some unfamiliar writing stamped onto it.

“That is a true gilthe. Or guilder if you prefer,” Abena explained with some satisfaction. “It’s the only sure way to be certain of who is and who isn’t an arcanist. Your mother asked to see mine before she let me ride with your troupe. It shows she’s a woman of the world.” She watched me with a sly disinterest. “Uncomfortable, isn’t it?”

I gritted my teeth and nodded. My hand had gone numb as soon as I’d touched it. I was curious to study the markings on its front and back, but after the space of two breaths, my arm was numb to the shoulder, as if I had slept on it all night. I wondered if my whole body would go numb if I held it long enough.

I was prevented from finding out, as the wagon hit a bump and my numbed hand almost let Abena’s guilder fall to the footboard of the wagon . She snatched it up and slipped it back over her head, chuckling.

“How can you stand it?” I asked, trying to rub a little feeling back into my hand.

“It only feels that way to other people,” she explained. “To its owner, it’s just warm. That’s how you can tell the difference between an arcanist and someone who has a knack for finding water or guessing at the weather.”

“Trip has something like that,” I said. “He rolls sevens.”

“That’s a little different,” Abena laughed. “Not anything so unexplainable as a knack.” She slouched a little farther down into her seat. “Probably for the best. A couple hundred years ago, a person was good as dead if folk saw they had a knack. The Tehlins called them demon signs, and burned folk if they had them.” Abena’s mood seemed to have taken a downward turn.

“We had to break Trip out of jail once or twice,” I said, trying to lighten the tone of the conversation. “But no one actually tried to burn him.”

Abena gave a tired smile. “I suspect Trip has a pair of clever dice or an equally clever skill which probably extends to cards as well. I thank you for your timely warning, but a knack is something else entirely.”

“Trip can’t cheat to save his life,” I said a little more sharply than I had intended. “And anyone in the troupe can tell good dice from bad. Trip throws sevens. It doesn’t matter whose dice he uses, he rolls sevens. If he bets on someone, they roll sevens. If he so much as bumps a table with loose dice on it, seven.”

“Hmmm.” Abena nodded to herself. “My apologies. That does sound like a knack. I’d be curious to see it.”

I nodded. “Take your own dice. We haven’t let him play for years.” A thought occurred to me. “It might not still work.”

She shrugged. “Knacks don’t go away so easily as that. When I was growing up in Staup, I knew a young woman with a knack. Uncommonly good with plants.” Abena’s grin was gone as she looked off at something I couldn’t see. “Her tomatoes would be red while everyone else’s vines were still climbing. Her squash were bigger and sweeter, her grapes didn’t hardly have to be bottled before they started being wine.” She trailed off, her eyes far away.

“Did they burn her?” I asked with the morbid curiosity of the young.

“What? No, of course not. I’m not that old.” She scowled at me in mock severity. “There was a drought and she got run out of town. Her poor father was heartbroken.”

There was a moment of silence. Two wagons ahead of us, I heard Teren and Shandi rehearsing lines from The Swineherd and the Nightingale.

Abena seemed to be listening as well, in an offhand way. After Teren got himself lost halfway through Fain’s garden monologue, I turned back to face her. “Do they teach acting at the University?” I asked.

Abena shook her head, slightly amused by the question. “Many things, but not that.”

I looked over at Abena and saw her watching me, her eyes danced.

“Could you teach me some of those other things?” I asked.

She smiled, and it was as easy as that.

---

Abena proceeded to give me a brief overview of each of the sciences. While her main love was for chemistry, she believed in a rounded education. I learned how to work the sextant, the compass, the slipstick, the abacus. More important, I learned to do without.

Within a span I could identify most chemicals in her cart. In two months I could distill liquor until it was too strong to drink, bandage a wound, set a bone, and diagnose hundreds of sicknesses from symptoms. 

I learned the formulae for a dozen poisons and acids and a hundred medicines and cure-alls, some of which even worked. I doubled my herb lore in theory if not in practice. Abena started to call me Red and I called her Bean, first in retaliation, then in friendship.

Only now, far after the fact, do I recognize how carefully Bean prepared me for what was to come at the University. She did it subtly. Once or twice a day, mixed in with my normal lectures, Bean would present me with a little mental exercise I would have to master before we went on to anything else. She made me play Tirani without a board, keeping track of the stones in my head. Other times she would stop in the middle of a conversation and make me repeat everything said in the last few minutes, word for word.

This was levels beyond the simple memorization I had practiced for the stage. My mind was learning to work in different ways, becoming stronger. It felt the same way your body feels after a day of splitting wood, or swimming, or sex. You feel exhausted, languorous. This feeling was similar, except it was my intellect that was weary and expanded, languid and latently powerful. I could feel my mind starting to awaken.

I seemed to gain momentum as I progressed, like when water starts to wash away a dam made of sand. A geometric progression is the best way to describe it. Through it all Bean continued to teach me mental exercises that I was half convinced she constructed out of sheer meanness.
