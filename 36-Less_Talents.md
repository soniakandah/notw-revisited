### *Chapter 36* 

# Less Talents

I SPENT THE NIGHT sleeping outside the city limits of Imre in a soft bed of heather. The next day I woke late, washed in a nearby stream, and made my way west to the University.

As I walked, I watched the horizon for the largest building in the University. From Bean’s descriptions I knew what it would look like: featureless, grey, and square as a block. Larger than four granaries stacked together. No windows, no decorations, and only one set of great stone doors. Ten times ten thousand books. The Archives.

I had come to the University for many reasons, but that was at the heart of it. The Archives held answers, and I had many, many questions. First and foremost, I wanted to know the truth about the Chandrian and the Amyr. I needed to know how much of Skari’s story was the truth.

When the road crossed the Omethi River, there was an old stone bridge. I don’t doubt that you know the type. It was one of those ancient, mammoth pieces of architecture scattered throughout the world, so old and solidly built that they have become part of the landscape, not a soul wondering who built them, or why. This one was particularly impressive, over two hundred feet long and wide enough for two wagons to pass each other, it stretched over the canyon the Omethi had carved into the rock. When I reached the crest of the bridge I saw the Archives for the first time in my life, rising like some great greystone over the trees to the west.

The University lay at the heart of a small city. Though truthfully, I hesitate to call it a city at all. It was nothing like Tarbean with its twisting alleys and garbage smell. It was more of a town, with wide roads and clean air. Lawns and gardens were spaced between small houses and shops.

But since this town had grown up to serve the peculiar needs of the University, a careful observer could note small differences in the services the town provided. For instance, there were two glassblowers, three fully stocked apothecaries, two binderies, four booksellers, two brothels, and a truly disproportionate number of taverns. One of them had a large wooden sign nailed to its door proclaiming, NO SYMPATHY! I wondered what non-arcane visitors might think of the warning.

The University itself consisted of about fifteen buildings that bore little resemblance to each other. Mews had a circular central hub with eight wings radiating in each direction so it looked like a compass rose. Hollows was simple and square, with stained glass windows showing Teccam in a classic pose: standing barefoot in the mouth of his cave, speaking to a group of students. Mains was the most distinctive building of the lot: it covered nearly an acre and a half and looked like it had been cobbled together from a number of smaller, mismatched buildings.

As I approached the Archives, its grey, windowless surface reminded me of an immense greystone. It was hard to believe after all the years of waiting that I was finally there. I circled around it until I found the entrance, a massive pair of stone doors standing wide open. Over them, chiseled deep into the stone, were the words Vorfelan Rhinata Morie. I didn’t recognize the language. It wasn’t Siaru…maybe Yllish, or Temic. Yet another question I needed answers for.

Through the stone doors was a small antechamber with a more ordinary set of wooden doors inside. I tugged them open and felt cool, dry air brush past me. The walls were bare grey stone, lit with the distinctive unwavering reddish light of sympathy lamps. There was a large wooden desk with several large, ledger-type books lying open atop it.

At the desk sat a young woman who looked to be a full-blooded Ceald, with the characteristic brown complexion and dark hair and eyes.

“Can I help you?” she asked, her voice thick with the harsh burr a Siaru accent makes.

“I’m here for the Archives,” I said stupidly. My stomach was dancing with butterflies. My palms were sweaty.

She looked me over, obviously wondering at my age. “Are you a student?”

“Soon,” I said. “I haven’t been through admissions yet.”

“You’ll need to do that first,” she said seriously. “I can’t let anyone in unless they’re in the book.” She gestured at the ledgers on the desk in front of her.

The butterflies died. I didn’t bother to hide my disappointment. “Are you sure I can’t look around just for a couple of minutes? I’ve come an awfully long way…” I looked at the two sets of double doors leading out of the room, one labeled TOMES the other STACKS. Behind the desk a smaller door was labeled SCRIVS ONLY.

Her expression softened somewhat. “I cannot. There would be trouble.” She looked me over again. “Are you really going through admissions?” her skepticism was obvious even through her thick accent.

I nodded. “I just came here first.” I said looking around the empty room, eyeing the closed doors, trying to think of some way to persuade her to let me in.

She spoke before I could think of anything. “If you’re really going, you should hurry. Today is the last day. Sometimes they don’t go much longer than noon.”

My heart beat hard and quick in my chest. I’d assumed they would run all day. “Where are they?”

“Hollows.” She gestured toward the outer door. “Down, then left. Short building with colored windows. Two big trees out front.” She paused. “Maple? Maybe Oak.”

I nodded and hurried outside, soon I was pelting down the road.

---

Two hours later I was in Hollows, fighting down a sour stomach and climbing up onto the stage of an empty theater. The room was dark except for the wide circle of light that held the masters’ table. I walked to stand at the edge of the light and waited. Slowly the nine masters stopped talking among themselves and turned to look at me.

They sat at a huge, crescent-shaped table. It was raised, so even seated they were looking down on me. They were all serious-looking, ranging in age from mature to ancient.

There was a long moment of silence before the woman sitting at the center of the crescent motioned me forward. I guessed she was the Chancellor. “Come up where we can see you. That’s right. Hello. Now, what’s your name, girl?”

“Kvoan, ma’am.”

“And why are you here?”

I looked her in the eye. “I want to attend the University. I want to be an arcanist.” I looked around at each of them. Some seemed amused. None looked particularly surprised.

“You are aware,” the Chancellor said. “That the University is for continuing one’s education. Not beginning it?”

“Yes, Chancellor. I know.”

“Very well,” she said. “May I have your letter of introduction?”

I didn’t hesitate. “I’m afraid I don’t have one, ma’am. Is it absolutely necessary?”

“It is customary to have a sponsor,” she explained. “Preferably an arcanist. Their letter tells us what you know. Your areas of excellence and weakness.”

“The arcanist I learned from was named Abena, ma’am. But she never gave me a letter of introduction. Might I tell you myself?”

The Chancellor nodded gravely, “Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing that you actually have studied with an arcanist without proof of some kind. Do you have anything that can corroborate your story? Any other correspondence?”

“She gave me a book before we parted ways, ma’am. She inscribed it to me and signed her name.”

The Chancellor smiled. “That should do nicely. Do you have it with you?”

“No.” I let some honest bitterness creep into my voice. “I had to pawn it in Tarbean.”

Sitting to the left of the Chancellor, Master Rhetorician Hemme made a disgusted noise at my comment, earning him an irritated look from the Chancellor. “Come, Burma,” Hemme said, slapping his hand on the table. “The girl is obviously lying. I have important matters to attend to this afternoon.”

The Chancellor gave him a vastly irritated look. “I have not given you leave to speak, Master Hemme.” The two of them stared at each other for a long moment before Hemme looked away, scowling.

The Chancellor turned back to me, then her eye caught some movement from one of the other masters. “Yes, Master Lorren?”

The tall, thin master looked at me passively. “What was the book called?”

“Rhetoric and Logic, ma’am.”

“And where did you pawn it?”

“The Broken Binding, on Seaward Square.”

Lorren turned to look at the Chancellor. “I will be leaving for Tarbean tomorrow to fetch necessary materials for the upcoming term. If it is there I will bring it back. The matter of the girl’s claim can be settled then.”

The Chancellor gave a small nod. “Thank you, Master Lorren.” She settled herself back into her chair and folded her hands in front of herself. “Very well, then. What would Abena’s letter tell us, if she had written it?”

I took a good breath. “She would say that I knew by heart the first ninety sympathetic bindings. That I could double-distill, perform titration, calcify, sublimate, and precipitate solution. That I am well versed in history, argument, grammars, medicine, and geometry.”

The Chancellor did her best to not look amused. “That’s quite a list. Are you sure you didn’t leave anything out?”

I paused. “She probably would have also mentioned my age, sir.”

“How old are you, girl?”

“Kvoan, ma’am.”

A smile tugged at the Chancellor’s face. “Kvoan.”

“Fifteen, ma’am.” There was a rustle as the masters each took some small action, exchanged glances, raised eyebrows, shook their heads. Hemme rolled his eyes skyward.

Only the Chancellor did nothing. “How exactly would she have mentioned your age?”

I gave a thin sliver of a smile. “She would have urged you to ignore it.”

There was a breath of silence. The Chancellor drew a deep breath and leaned back in her seat. “Very well. We have a few questions for you. Would you like to begin, Master Brandeur?” She made a gesture toward one end of the crescent table.

I turned to face Brandeur. Portly and balding, he was the University’s Master Arithmetician. “How many grains are in thirteen ounces?”

“Six thousand two hundred and forty,” I said immediately.

He raised his eyebrows a little. “If I had fifty silver talents and converted them to Vintish coin and back, how much would I have if the Cealdim took four percent each time?”

I started the ponderous conversion between currencies, then smiled as I realized it was unnecessary. “Forty-six talents and eight drabs, if they’re honest. Forty-six even if they’re not.”

He nodded again, looking at me more closely. “You have a triangle,” he said slowly. “One side is seven feet. Another side, three feet. One angle is sixty degrees. How long is the other side?”

“Is the angle between the two sides?” He nodded. I closed my eyes for the space of half a breath, then opened them again. “Six feet six inches. Dead even.”

He made a hmmmpfh noise and looked surprised. “Good enough. Master Arwyl?”

Arwyl asked her question before I had time to turn and to face her. “What are the medicinal properties of hellebore?”

“Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, mild sedative, mild analgesic. Blood purifier.” I said, looking up at the grandmotherly, spectacled old woman. “Toxic if used excessively. Dangerous for women who are with child.”

“Name the component structures that comprise the hand.”

I named all twenty-seven bones, then the muscles from largest to smallest. I listed them quickly, matter-of-factly, pointing out their locations on my own upraised hand.

The speed and accuracy of my answers impressed them. Some of them hid it, others wore it openly on their faces. The truth was, I needed to impress them. I knew from my previous discussions with Bean that you needed money or brains to get into the University. The more of one you had, the less of the other you needed.

So I was cheating. I had snuck into Hollows through a back entrance, acting the part of an errand girl. Then I’d picked two locks and spent more than an hour watching other students’ interviews. I heard hundreds of questions and thousands of answers.

I also heard how high the other students’ tuitions were set. The lowest had been four talents and six jots, but most were double that. One student had been charged over thirty talents for their tuition. It would be easier for me to get a piece of the moon than that much money.

I had two copper jots in my pocket and no way to get a bent penny more. So I needed to impress them. More than that. I needed to confound them with my intelligence. To dazzle them.

I finished listing the muscles of the hand and started in on the ligatures when Arwyl waved me into silence and asked her next question. “When do you bleed a patient?”

The question brought me up short. “When I want them to die?” I asked dubiously.

She nodded, mostly to herself. “Master Lorren?”

Master Lorren was pale and seemed unnaturally tall even while sitting. “Who was the first declared queen of Tarvintas?”

“Posthumously? Feyda Calanthis. Otherwise it would be her sister, Jarsa.”

“Why did the Aturan Empire collapse?”

I paused, taken aback by the scope of the question. None of the other students had been asked anything so broad as this. “Well ma’am,” I said slowly to give myself a moment or two to organize my thoughts. “Partly because Lady Nalto was an inept egomaniac. Partly because the church went into upheaval and denounced the Order Amyr who were a large part of the strength of Atur. Partly because the military was fighting three different wars of conquest at the same time, and high taxes fomented rebellion in lands already inside the empire.”

I watched the master’s expression, hoping she would give some sign when she had heard enough. “They also debased their currency, undercut the universality of the iron law, and antagonized the Adem.” I shrugged. “But of course it’s more complicated than that.”

Master Lorren’s expression remained unchanged, but she nodded. “Who was the greatest person who ever lived?”

Another unfamiliar question . I thought for a minute. “Illien.”

Master Lorren blinked once, expressionless. “Master Mardran?”

Mardran was a clean-shaven and smooth-faced man, with hands stained a half hundred different colors and seemed to be made all of knuckle and bone. “If you needed phosphorus where would you get it?”

His tone sounded for a moment so much like Abena’s that I forgot myself and spoke without thinking. “An apothecary?” One of the masters on the other side of the table chuckled and I bit my too-quick tongue.

He gave me a faint smile, and I drew a faint breath. “Barring access to an apothecary.”

“I could render it from urine,” I said quickly. “Given a kiln and enough time.”

“How much would you need to gain two ounces pure?” He cracked his knuckles absentmindedly.

I paused to consider, as this was a new question too. “At least forty gallons, Master Mandrag, depending on the quality of the material.”

There was a long pause as he cracked his knuckles one at a time. “What are the three most important rules of the chemist?”

This I knew from Bean. “Label clearly. Measure twice. Eat elsewhere.”

He nodded, still wearing the faint smile. “Master Kilvin?”

Kilvin was Cealdish, her thick shoulders and bristling black hair reminded me of a bear. “Right,” she muttered, folding her hands in front of her. “How would you make an ever-burning lamp?”

Each of the other eight masters made some sort of exasperated noise or gesture.

“What?” Kilvin demanded, looking around at them, irritated. “It is my question. The asking is mine.” She turned her attention back to me. “So. How would you make it?”

“Well,” I said slowly. “I would probably start with a pendulum of some sort. Then I would bind it to-”

“Kraem. No. Not like this.” Kilvin growled out a couple words and pounded her fist on the table, each thump as her hand came down was accompanied by a staccato burst of reddish light that welled up from her hand. “No sympathy. I do not want an ever-glowing lamp. I want an ever-burning one.” She looked at me again, her expression harsh but not cruel.

“Lithium salt?” I asked without thinking, then backpedaled. “No, a sodium oil that burned in an enclosed…no, damn.” I mumbled my way to a stop. The other applicants hadn’t had to deal with questions like these.

She cut me off with a short sideways gesture of her hand. “Enough. We will talk later. Elxa Dal.”

It took me a moment to remember that Elxa Dal was the next master. I turned to her. She looked like the archetypal sinister magician that seems to be a requirement in so many bad Aturan plays. Severe dark eyes, lean face, straight thin hair. For all that, her expression was friendly enough. “What are the words for the first parallel kinetic binding?”

I rattled them off glibly.

She didn’t seem surprised. “What was the binding that Master Kilvin used just a moment ago?”

“Capacatorial Kinetic Luminosity.”

“What is the synodic period?”

I looked at her oddly. “Of the moon?” The question seemed a little out of sync with the other two.

She nodded.

“Seventy-two and a third days, ma’am. Give or take a bit.”

She shrugged and gave a wry smile, as if she’d expected to catch me with the last question. “Master Hemme?”

Hemme looked at me over steepled fingers. “How much mercury would it take to reduce two gills of white sulfur?” he asked pompously, as if I’d already given the wrong answer.

One of the things I’d learned during my hour of quiet observation was this: Master Hemme was the king-high bastard of the lot. He took delight in student’s discomfort and did everything he could to badger and unsettle them. He had a fondness for trick questions.

Luckily, this was one I had watched him use on other students. You see, you can’t reduce white sulfur with mercury. “Well,” I drew the word out, pretending to think it through. Hemme’s smug smile grew wider by the second. “Assuming you mean red sulfur, it would be about forty-one ounces. Sir.” I smiled a sharp smile at him. All teeth.

“Name the nine prime fallacies,” he snapped.

“Simplification. Generalization. Circularity. Reduction. Analogy. False causality. Semantism. Irrelevancy…” I paused, not being able to remember the formal name of the last one. Bean and I had called it Nalt, after Empress Nalto. It galled me, not being able to recall its real name, as I had read it in Rhetoric and Logic just a few days ago.

My irritation must have shown on my face. Hemme glowered at me as I paused, saying. “So you don’t know everything after all?” He leaned back into his seat with a satisfied expression.

“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t think I had anything to learn,” I said bitingly before I managed to get my tongue under control again. From the other side of the table, Kilvin gave a deep chuckle.

Hemme opened his mouth, but the Chancellor silenced him with a look before he could say anything else. “Now then,” the Chancellor began, “I think-”

“I too would ask some questions,” the woman to the Chancellor’s right said. She had an accent that I couldn’t quite place. Or perhaps it was that her voice held a certain resonance. When she spoke, everyone at the desk stirred slightly, then grew still, like leaves touched by the wind.

“Master Namer,” the Chancellor said with equal parts deference and trepidation.

Elodia was younger than the others by at least a dozen years. She had soft features with deep eyes. Overall here was nothing particularly striking about her, except for the way she sat at the table, one moment watching something intently, the next minute bored and letting her attention wander among the high beams of the ceiling above. She was almost like a child who had been forced to sit down with adults.

I felt Master Elodia look at me. Actually felt it. I suppressed a shiver. “Soheketh ka Siaru krema’teth tu?” she asked. How well do you speak Siaru?

“Rieusa, ta krelar deala tu.” Not very well, thank you.

She lifted a hand, her index finger pointing upward. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

I paused for a moment, which was more consideration than the question seemed to warrant. “At least one,” I said. “Probably no more than six.”

She broke into a broad smile and brought her other hand up from underneath the table, it had two fingers upright. She waved them back and forth for the other masters to see, nodding her head from side to side in an absent, childish way. Then she lowered her hands to the table in front of her, and grew suddenly serious. “Do you know the seven words that will make someone love you?”

I looked at her, trying to decide if there was more to the question. When nothing more was forthcoming, I answered simply, “No.”

“They exist.” She reassured me, and sat back with a look of contentment. “Master Linguist?” She nodded to the Chancellor.

“That seems to cover most of academia,” the Chancellor said almost to herself. I had the impression that something had unsettled her, but she was too composed for me to tell exactly what. “You will forgive me if I ask a few things of a less scholarly nature?”

Having no real choice, I nodded.

She gave me a long look that seemed to stretch several minutes. “Why didn’t Abena send a letter of recommendation with you?”

I hesitated. Not all traveling entertainers are as respectable as our troupe, so, understandably, not everyone respected them. But I doubted that lying was the best course of action. “She left my troupe three years ago. I haven’t seen her since.”

I saw each of the masters look at me. I could almost hear them doing the mental arithmetic, calculating my age backward.

“Oh come now,” Hemme said disgustedly and moved as if he would stand.

The Chancellor gave him a dark look, silencing him. “Why do you wish to attend the University?”

I stood dumbfounded. It was the one question I was completely unprepared for. What could I say? Ten thousand books. Your Archives. I used to have dreams of reading there when I was young. True, but too childish. I want revenge against the Chandrian. Too dramatic. To become so powerful that no one will ever be able to hurt me again. Too frightening.

I looked up to the Chancellor and realized I’d been quiet for a long while. Unable to think of anything else, I shrugged and said, “I don’t know, ma’am. I guess I’ll have to learn that too.”

The Chancellor’s eyes had taken on a curious look by this point but she pushed it aside as she said, “Is there anything else you would like to say?” She had asked the question of the other applicants, but none of them had taken advantage of it. It seemed almost rhetorical, a ritual before the masters discussed the applicant’s tuition.

“Yes, please,” I said, surprising her. “I have a favor to ask beyond mere admission.” I took a deep breath, letting their attention settle on me. “It has taken me nearly three years to get here. I may seem young, but I know I belong here.”

I paused. “However, at this moment I have two jots in my purse and nowhere in the world to get more than that. I have nothing worth selling that I haven’t already sold.

“Admit me for more than two jots and I will not be able to attend. Admit me for less and I will be here every day, while every night I will do what it takes to stay alive while I study here. I will sleep in alleys and stables, wash dishes for kitchen scraps, beg pennies to buy pens. I will do whatever it takes.” I said the last words fiercely, almost daring them to challenge my resolve.

“But admit me free, and give me three talents so I can live and buy what I need to learn properly, and I will be a student the likes of which you have never seen before.”

There was a half-breath of silence, followed by a thunderclap of a laugh from Kilvin. “HA!” she roared. “If one student in ten had half her fire I’d teach with a whip and chair instead of chalk and slate.” She brought her hand down hard on the table in front of her.

This sparked everyone to begin talking at the same time in their own varied tones. The Chancellor made a little wave in my direction and I took the chance to seat myself in the chair that stood at the edge of the circle of light.

The discussion seemed to go on for quite a long while. But even two or three minutes would have seemed like an eternity, sitting there while a group of old masters debated my future. There was no actual shouting, but a fair amount of hand waving, most of it by Master Hemme, who seemed to have taken the same dislike of me that I had for him.

It wouldn’t have been so bad if I could have understood what they were saying, but even my finely tuned eavesdropper’s ears couldn’t quite make out what was being said.

Their talking died down suddenly, and then the Chancellor looked in my direction, motioning me forward.

“Let it be recorded,” she said formally, “that Kvoan, daughter of-” She paused and then looked at me inquiringly.

“Arladay,” I supplied. The name sounded strange to me after all these years. Master Lorren turned to look in my direction, blinking once.

“...daughter of Arladay, is admitted into the University for the continuance of her education on the forty-third of Caitelyn. Her admission into the Arcanum contingent upon proof that she has mastered the basic principles of sympathy. Official sponsor being one Kilvin, Master Artificer. Her tuition shall be set at the rate of less three talents.”

I felt a great dark weight settle inside me. Three talents might as well be all the money in the world for any hope I had in earning it before the term began. Working in kitchens, running errands for pennies, I might be able to save that much in a year, if I was lucky.

I held a desperate hope that I could cutpurse that much in time. But I knew the thought to be just that, desperate. People with that sort of money generally knew better than to leave it hanging in a purse.

I didn’t realize that the masters had left the table until one of them approached me. I looked up to see the Master Archivist approaching me.

Lorren was taller than I would have guessed, over six and a half feet. Her long face and hands made her look almost stretched. When she saw she had my attention, she asked, “Did you say your mother’s name was Arladay?”

She asked it very calmly, with no hint of regret or apology in her voice. It suddenly made me very angry, that she should stifle my ambitions of getting into the University then come over and ask about my dead mother as easy as saying good morning.

“Yes.” I said tightly.

“Arladay the bard?”

My mother always thought of herself as a trouper. She never called herself bard or minstrel. Hearing her referred to in that way irritated me even more, if that were possible. I didn’t deign to reply, merely nodded once, sharply.

If she thought my response terse she didn’t show it. “I was wondering which troupe she performed in.”

My thin restraint burst. “Well maybe you can wonder a while longer as I’m stuck in ignorance now. When I come back after earning my three talents, maybe then you can ask me again.” I gave her a fierce look, as if hoping to burn her with my eyes.

Her reaction was minimal, it wasn’t until later that I found getting any reaction from Master Lorren was about as likely as seeing a stone pillar wink.

She looked vaguely puzzled at first, then slightly taken aback, then, as I glared up at her, she gave a faint, thin smile and mutely handed me a piece of paper.

I unfolded and read it. It read: “Kvoan. Spring term. Tuition: -3. Tln.” Less three talents. Of course.

Relief flooded me. As if it were a great wave that swept my legs from beneath me, I sat suddenly on the floor and wept.
