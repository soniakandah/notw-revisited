### *Interlude*

# Flesh with Blood Beneath

IN THE WAYSTONE INN there was a silence. It surrounded the two women sitting at a table in an otherwise empty room. Kvoan had stopped speaking, and while she seemed to be staring down at her folded hands, in reality her eyes were far away. When she finally pulled her gaze upward, she seemed almost surprised to find Chronicler sitting across the table, pen poised above her inkwell.

Kvoan let out her breath self-consciously and motioned Chronicler to set down her pen. After a moment Chronicler complied, wiping the nib of the pen on a clean cloth before setting it down.

"I could use a drink," Kvoan announced suddenly, as if she were surprised. "I haven't told many stories lately, and I find myself unreasonably dry." She rose smoothly from the table and began to make her way through the maze of empty tables toward the empty bar. "I can offer you almost anything, dark ale, pale wine, spiced cider, chocolate, coffee..."

Chronicler raised an eyebrow. "Chocolate would be wonderful, if you have it. I wouldn't expect to find that sort of thing this far from..." She cleared her throat politely. "Well, anywhere."

"We have everything here at the Waystone," Kvoan said, making an offhand gesture to the empty room. "Excepting any customers, of course." She brought an earthenware jug up from underneath the bar, then set it on the bar with a hollow sound. She sighed before calling out, "Bassa! Bring up some cider, would you?"

An indistinct reply echoed from a doorway at the back of the room.

"Bassa," Kvoan chided, seemingly too quiet to be heard.

"Come down here and get it yourself!" the voice shouted up from the basement. "I'm in the middle of something."

"Hired help?" Chronicler asked.

Kvoan leaned her elbows on the bar and smiled indulgently.

After a moment, the sound of someone climbing a set of wooden stairs in hard-soled boots echoed from the doorway. Bassa stepped into the room, muttering under her breath.

She was dressed simply: black long-sleeved shirt tucked into black pants; black pants tucked into soft black boots. Her face was sharp and delicate, almost beautiful, with striking blue eyes.

She carried a jug to the bar, walking with a strange and not unpleasant grace. "One customer?" she said reproachfully. "You couldn't get it yourself? You pulled me away from Celum Tinture. You've been harping on me to read it for nearly a month now."

"Bassa, do you know what they do to students at the University who eavesdrop on their teachers?" Kvoan asked archly.

Bassa put a hand on her chest and began to protest her innocence.

"Bassa..." Kvoan gave her a stern look.

Bassa closed her mouth and for a moment looked as if she was about to try and offer some explanation, then her shoulders slumped. "How did you know?"

Kvoan chuckled. "You've been avoiding that book for a mortal age. Either you had suddenly become an exceptionally dedicated student, or you were doing something incriminating."

"What do they do to students at the University who eavesdrop?" Bassa asked curiously.

"I haven't the slightest idea. I was never caught. I think making you sit and listen to the rest of my story should be punishment enough. But I forget myself," Kvoan said, gesturing to the common room. "We are neglecting our guest."

Chronicler seemed anything but bored. As soon as Bassa entered the room, Chronicler began to watch her curiously. As the conversation continued, Chronicler's expression had grown by degrees more puzzled and more intent.

In fairness, something ought to be said about Bassa. At first glance, she looked to be an average, if attractive, young woman. But there was something different about her. For instance, she wore soft black leather boots. At least, if you looked at her that's what you saw. But if you happened to catch a glimpse of her from the corner of your eye, and if she were standing in the right type of shadow, you might see something else entirely.

And if you had the right sort of mind, the sort of mind that actually sees what it looks at, you might notice that her eyes were odd. If your mind had the rare talent of not being fooled by its own expectations, you might notice something else about them, something strange and wonderful.

Because of this, Chronicler had been staring at Kvoan's young student, trying to decide what was different about her. By the time their conversation was through, Chronicler's gaze would be considered intense at the very least, and rude by most. When Bassa finally turned from the bar, Chronicler's eyes widened perceptibly, and the color drained from her already pale face.

Chronicler reached inside her shirt and tugged something from around her neck. She set it on the table at arm's length, between herself and Bassa. All this was done in half a second, and her eyes never left the dark-haired young woman at the bar. Chronicler's face was calm as she pressed the metal disk firmly onto the table with two fingers.

"*Iron*," she said. Her voice sounded with a strange resonance, as if it were an order to be obeyed.

Bassa doubled over as if punched in the stomach, baring her teeth and making a noise halfway between a growl and a scream. Moving with an unnatural, sinuous speed, she drew one hand back to the side of her head and tensed herself to spring.

It all happened in the time it takes to draw a sharp breath. Still, somehow, Kvoan's long-fingered hand caught Bassa's wrist. Unaware or uncaring, Bassa leaped toward Chronicler only to be brought up short, as if Kvoan's hand were a shackle. Bassa struggled furiously to free herself, but Kvoan stood behind the bar, arm outstretched, motionless as steel or stone.

"Stop!" Kvoan's voice struck the air like a commandment, and in the stillness that followed, her words were sharp and angry. "I will have no fighting among my friends. I have lost enough without that." Her eyes caught Chronicler. "Undo that, or I will break it."

Chronicler paused, shaken. Then her mouth moved silently, and with a slight tremor she drew her hand away from the circle of dull metal that lay upon the table.

Tension poured out of Bassa, and for a moment she hung limply as a rag doll from the wrist Kvoan still held, standing behind the bar. Shakily, Bassa managed to find her feet and lean against the bar . Kvoan gave her a long, searching look, then released her wrist.

Bassa slumped onto the stool without taking her eyes from Chronicler. She moved gingerly, like an animal with a tender wound.

And she had changed. The eyes that watched Chronicler were still a striking ocean blue, but now they showed themselves to be all one color, like gems or deep forest pools, and her soft leather boots had been replaced with graceful cloven hooves.

Kvoan motioned Chronicler forward imperiously, then turned to grab two thick glasses and a bottle seemingly at random. She set the glasses down as Bassa and Chronicler eyed each other uneasily.

"Now," Kvoan said angrily, "you've both acted understandably, but that does not by any means mean that either of you has behaved well. So, we might as well start over altogether."

She drew a deep breath. "Bassa, let me introduce you to Delva Lochees, also known as Chronicler. By all accounts a great teller, rememberer, and recorder of stories. In addition, unless I have suddenly lost all my wit, an accomplished member of the Arcanum, at least Re'lar, and one of perhaps two score people in the world who knows the name of iron.

"However," Kvoan continued, "in spite of these accolades she seems to be a bit innocent of the ways of the world. As demonstrated by her plentiful lack of wit in making a near-suicidal attack on what I guess is the first of the folk she has ever had the luck to see."

Chronicler stood impassively throughout the introduction, watching Bassa as if she were a snake.

"Chronicler, I would like you to meet Bassa, daughter of Remmen, Princess of Twilight and the Telwyth Mael. The brightest, which is to say the only student I've had the misfortune to teach. Glamourer, bartender, and, not last, my friend.

"Who, over the course of a hundred and fifty years of life, not to mention nearly two years of my personal tutelage, has managed to avoid learning a few important facts. The first being this: attacking a member of the Arcanum skilled enough to make a binding of iron is foolish."

"She attacked me!" said Bassa hotly.

Kvoan looked at her coolly. "I didn't say it was unjustified. I said it was foolish."

"I would have won."

"Very likely. But you would have been hurt, and she would be hurt or dead. Do you remember that I had introduced her as my guest?"

Bassa was silent. Her expression remained belligerent.

"Now," said Kvoan with a brittle cheerfulness. "You've been introduced."

"Pleased," Bassa said icily.

"Likewise," Chronicler returned.

"There is no reason for you two to be anything other than friends," Kvoan continued, an edge creeping into her voice. "And that is not how friends greet each other."

Bassa and Chronicler stared at each other, neither moved.

Kvoan's voice grew quiet, "If you do not stop this foolishness, you may both leave now. One of you will be left with a slim sliver of story, and the other can search out a new teacher. If there is one thing I will not abide, it is the folly of a willful pride."

Something about the low intensity of Kvoan's voice broke the stare between them. And when they turned to look at her it seemed that someone very different was standing behind the bar. The jovial innkeeper was gone, and in her place stood someone dark and fierce.

*She's so young,* Chronicler marveled. *She can't be more than twenty-five. Why didn't I see it before? She could break me in her hands like a kindling stick. How did I ever mistake her for an innkeeper, even for a moment?*

Then she saw Kvoan's eyes. They had deepened to a green so dark they were nearly black. *This is who I came to see,* Chronicler thought to herself, *this is the woman who counseled royalty and walked the old roads. This is the woman whose name has become both praise and curse at the University.*

Kvoan stared at Chronicler and Bassa in turn; neither could meet her eye for very long. After an awkward pause, Bassa extended her hand. Chronicler hesitated for a bare moment before reaching out quickly, as if she were sticking her hand into a fire.

Nothing happened, both of them seemed moderately surprised.

"Amazing, isn't it?" Kvoan addressed them bitingly. "Five fingers and flesh with blood beneath. One could almost believe that on the other end of that hand lay a person of some sort."

Guilt crept into the expressions of the two. They let go of each other's hands.

Kvoan poured something from the green bottle into the glasses. This simple gesture changed her. She seemed to fade back into herself, until there was little left of the dark-eyed woman who'd stood behind the bar a moment ago. Chronicler felt a pang of loss as she stared at the innkeeper with one hand hidden in a linen rag.

"Now." Kvoan pushed the glasses toward them. "Take these drinks, sit at that table, and talk. When I come back, I don't want to find either one of you dead or the building on fire. Fair?"

Bassa gave an embarrassed smile as Chronicler picked up the glasses and moved back to the table. Bassa followed her and almost sat down before returning to grab the bottle too.

"Not too much of that," Kvoan cautioned as she stepped into the back room. "I don't want you giggling through my story."

The two at the table began a tense, halting conversation as Kvoan moved into the kitchen. Several minutes later she emerged, bringing out cheese and a loaf of dark bread, cold chicken and sausage, butter and honey.

They moved to a larger table as Kvoan brought the platters out, bustling about and looking every bit the innkeeper. Chronicler watched her covertly, finding it hard to believe that this woman humming to herself and cutting sausage could be the same person who had stood behind the bar just minutes ago, dark-eyed and terrible.

As Chronicler gathered her paper and quills, Kvoan studied the angle of the sun through the window, a pensive look on her face. Eventually she turned to Bassa. "How much did you manage to overhear?"

"Most of it, Reshi," Bassa smiled. "I have good ears."

"That's good. We don't have time to backtrack." She drew a deep breath. "Let's get back to it then. Brace yourselves, the story takes a turn now. Downward. Darker. Clouds on the horizon."
