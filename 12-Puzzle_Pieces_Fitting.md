### *Chapter 12*

# Puzzle Pieces Fitting

TOWARD THE END OF the summer I accidentally overheard a conversation that shook me out of my state of blissful ignorance. When we are children we seldom think of the future. This innocence leaves us free to enjoy ourselves as few adults can. The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.

It was evening, and the troupe was camped by the side of the road. Abena had given me a new piece of sympathy to practice: The Maxim of Variable Heat Transferred to Constant Motion, or something pretentious like that.

It was tricky, but it had fallen into place like a puzzle piece fitting. It had taken about fifteen minutes, and from Abena’s tone I guessed she had expected it to take at least twice as much.

So I went looking for her. Partly to get my next lesson, and partly so that I could be just a little bit smug.

I tracked her down to my parent’s wagon. I heard the three of them long before I saw them. Their voices were just murmurs, the distant music that a conversation makes when it’s too dim for words. But as I was coming close I heard one word clearly: Chandrian.

I pulled up short when I heard that. Everyone in the troupe knew my mother was working on a song. She’d been teasing old stories and rhymes from townsfolk for over a year wherever we stopped to play.

For months it was stories about Lanre. Then she started gathering old faerie stories too, legends about bogies and shamble-folk. Then she began to ask questions about the Chandrian…

That was months ago. Over the last half year she had asked more about the Chandrian and less about Lanre, Lyra, and the rest. Most songs my mother set to writing were finished in a single season, while this one was stretching toward its second year.

You should know this as well, my mother never let word or whisper of a song be heard before it was ready to play. Only my father was allowed into her confidence, as his hand was always in any song she made. The cleverness in the music was hers. The best words were his.

When you wait a few span or month to hear a finished song, the anticipation adds savor. But after a year excitement begins to sour. By now, a year and a half had passed and folk were almost mad with curiosity. This occasionally led to hard words when someone was caught wandering a little too close to our wagon while my mother and father were working.

So I moved closer to my parent’s fire, stepping softly. Eavesdropping is a deplorable habit, but I have developed worse ones since.

“…much about them,” I heard Bean say. “But I’m willing.”

“I’m glad to talk with an educated woman on the subject.” My mother’s strong voice was a contrast to Bean’s bright one. “I’m weary of these superstitious country folk, and the…”

Someone added wood to the fire and I lost my mother’s words in the crackling that followed. Stepping as quickly as I dared, I moved into the long shadow of my parent’s wagon.

“…like I’m chasing ghosts with this song. Trying to piece together this story is a fool’s game. I wish I’d never started it.”

“Nonsense,” my father said. “This will be your best work, and you know it.”

“So you think there is an original story all the others stem from?” Bean asked. “A historical basis for Lanre?”

“All the signs point to it,” my mother said. “It’s like looking at a dozen grandchildren and seeing ten of them have blue eyes. You know the grandmother had blue eyes, too. I’ve done this before, I’m good at it. I wrote “Below the Walls” the same way. But…” I heard her sigh.

“What’s the problem then?”

“The story’s older,” my father explained. “It’s more like she’s looking at great-great-grandchildren.”

“And they’re scattered to the four corners,” my mother groused. “And when I finally do find one, it’s got five eyes: two greens, a blue, a brown, and a chartreuse. Then the next one has only one eye, and it changes colors. How am I supposed to draw conclusions from that?”

Bean cleared her throat. “A disturbing analogy,” she said. “But you’re welcome to pick my brain about the Chandrian. I’ve heard a lot of stories over the years.”

“The first thing I need to know is how many there actually are,” my mother said. “Most stories say seven, but even that’s conflicted. Some say three, others five, and in Felior’s Fall there are a full thirteen of them: one for each pontifet in Atur, and an extra for the capitol.”

“That I can answer,” Bean said. “Seven. You can hold to that with some certainty. It’s part of their name, actually. Chaen means seven. Chaen-dian means ‘seven of them.’ Chandrian.”

“I didn’t know that,” my mother said. “Chaen. What language is that? Yllish?”

“Sounds like Tema,” my father said.

“You’ve got a good ear,” Bean said to him. “It’s Temic, actually. Predates Tema by about a thousand years.”

“Well that simplifies things,” I heard my mother say. “I wish I’d asked you a month ago. I don’t suppose you know why they do what they do?” I could tell by my mother’s tone that she didn’t really expect an answer.

“That’s the real mystery, isn’t it?” Bean chuckled. “I think that’s what makes them more frightening than the rest of the ghouls you hear about in stories. A ghost wants revenge, a demon wants your soul, the shamble-folk are hungry and cold. It makes them less terrible. Things we understand we can try to control. But Chandrian come like lightning from a clear blue sky. Just destruction. No rhyme or reason to it.”

“My song will have both,” my mother said with grim determination. “I think I’ve dug up their reason, after all this while. I’ve teased it together from bits and pieces of story. That’s what’s so galling about this, to have the harder part of this done and have all these small specifics giving me such trouble.”

“You think you know?” Bean said curiously. “What’s your theory?”

My mother gave a low chuckle. “Oh no Abena, you’ll have to wait with the others. I’ve sweated too long over this song to give away the heart of it before it’s finished.”

I could hear the disappointment in Bean’s voice. “I’m sure this is all just an elaborate ruse to keep me traveling with you,” she groused. “I won’t be able to leave until I’ve heard the blackened thing.”

“Then help us finish it,” my father said. “The Chandrian’s signs are another key piece of information we can’t nail down. Everyone agrees there are signs that warn of their presence, but nobody agrees on what they are.”

“Let me think…” Bean said. “Blue flame is obvious, of course. But I’d hesitate to attribute that to the Chandrian in particular. In some stories it’s a sign of demons. In others it’s fae creatures, or magic of any sort.”

“It shows bad air in mines, too,” my father pointed out.

“Does it?” my mother asked.

He nodded. “When a lamp burns with a blue haze you know there’s firedamp in the air.”

“Good lord, firedamp in a coal mine,” my mother said. “Blow out your light and get lost in the black, or leave it burn and blow the whole place to flinders. That’s more frightening than any demon.”

“I’ll also admit to the fact that certain arcanists occasionally use prepared candles or torches to impress gullible townsfolk,” Bean said, clearing her throat self-consciously.

My father laughed. “Remember who you’re talking to, Abena. We’d never hold a little showmanship against someone. In fact, blue candles would be just the thing the next time we play Daeonica. If you happened to find a couple tucked away somewhere, that is.”

“I’ll see what I can do,” Bean said, her voice amused. “Other signs…one of them is supposed to have eyes like a goat, or no eyes, or black eyes. I’ve heard that one quite a bit. I’ve heard that plants die when the Chandrian are around. Wood rots, metal rusts, brick crumbles…” She paused. “Though I don’t know if that’s several signs, or all one sign.”

“You begin to see the trouble I’m having,” my mother said morosely. “And there’s still the question as to if they all share the same signs, or have a couple each.”

“I’ve told you,” my father said, exasperated. “One sign for each of them. It makes the most sense.”

“My dear husband’s favorite theory,” my mother said. “But it doesn’t fit. In some stories the only sign is blue flame. In others you have animals going crazy and no blue flame. In others you have a man with black eyes and animals going mad and blue flame.”

“I’ve told you how to make sense of that,” he said, his exasperated tone indicating they’d had this particular discussion before. “They don’t always have to be together. They could go out in threes or fours. If one of them makes fires dim, then it’ll look the same as if they all made the fires dim. That would account for the differences in the stories. Different numbers and different signs depending on how they’re grouped together.”

My mother grumbled something.

“That’s a clever man you have there, Arla.” Bean spoke up, breaking the tension. “Where ever did you learn your wit, good sir?”

“Alas it be far from this place, for I was a well-learned man before this temptress whisked me away to her caravan” There was as snorty laugh from my mother as my father’s voice grew more sly. 

“Back to the matter at hand,” my mother interjected, her voice more playful than before, “are there any other signs that spring to mind?”

“They’re supposed to be cold to the touch. Though how anyone could know that is beyond me. I’ve heard that fires don’t burn around them. Though that directly contradicts the blue flame. It could-”

The wind picked up, stirring the trees. The rustling leaves drowned out what Bean said. I took advantage of the noise to creep a few steps closer.

“…being ‘yoked to shadow,’ whatever that means,” I heard my mother say as the wind died down.

Bean sighed. “I couldn’t say either. I heard a story where they were given away because their shadows pointed the wrong way, toward the light. And there was another where one of them was referred to as ‘shadow-hamed.’ It was ‘something the shadow-hamed.’ Damned if I can remember the name though…”

“Speaking of names, that’s another point I’m having trouble with,” my mother said. “There are a couple dozen I’ve collected that I’d appreciate your opinion on. The most-”

“Actually, Arla,” Bean interrupted, “I’d appreciate it if you didn’t say them out loud. Names of people, that is. You can scratch them in the dirt if you’d like, or I could go fetch a slate, but I’d be more comfortable if you didn’t actually say any of them. Better safe than sore, as they say.”

There was a deep piece of silence. I stopped mid-sneak with one foot off the ground, afraid they’d heard me.

“Now don’t go looking at me like that, either of you,” Bean said testily.

“We’re just surprised, Abena,” came my father’s gentle voice. “You don’t seem the superstitious type.”

“I’m not,” Bean said. “I’m careful. There’s a difference.”

“Of course,” my mother said. “I’d never-”

“Save it for the paying customers, Arla,” Bean cut her off, irritation plain in her voice. “You’re too good an actor to show it, but I know perfectly well when someone thinks I’m daft .”

“I just didn’t expect it, Abena,” my mother said apologetically. “You’re educated, and I’m so tired of people touching iron and tipping their beer as soon as I mention the Chandrian. I’m just reconstructing a story, not meddling with dark arts.”

“Well, hear me out. I like both of you too well to let you think of me as an old fool,” Bean said. “Besides, I have something to talk with you about later, and I’ll need you to take me seriously for that.”

The wind continued to pick up, and I used the noise to cover my last few steps. I edged around the corner of my parents’ wagon and peered through a veil of leaves. The three of them were sitting around the campfire. Bean was sitting on a stump, huddled in her frayed brown cloak. My parents were opposite her, my mother leaning against my father, a blanket draped loosely around them.

Bean poured from a clay jug into a leather mug and handed it to my mother. Her breath fogged as she spoke. “How do they feel about demons off in Atur?” she asked.

“Scared.” My mother tapped her temple. “All that religion makes their brains soft.”

“How about off in Vintas?” Bean asked. “Fair number of them are Tehlins. Do they feel the same way?”

My father shook his head. “They think it’s a little silly. They like their demons metaphorical.”

“What are they afraid of at night in Vintas then?”

“The Fae,” my father said.

My mother spoke at the same time. “Draugar.”

“You’re both right, depending on which part of the country you’re in,” Bean said. “And here in the Commonwealth people laugh up their sleeves at both ideas.” She gestured at the surrounding trees. “But here they’re careful come autumn-time for fear of drawing the attention of shamble-folk.”

“That’s the way of things,” my mother said. “Half of being a good trouper is knowing which way your audience leans.”

“You still think I’ve gone cracked in the head,” Bean said, amused. “Listen, if tomorrow we pulled into Biren and someone told you there were shamble-folk in the woods, would you believe them?” My mother shook her head. “What if two people told you?” Another shake.

Bean leaned forward on her stump. “What if a dozen people told you, with perfect earnestness, that shamble-folk were out in the fields, eating-”

“Of course I wouldn’t believe them,” my mother said, irritated. “It’s ridiculous.”

“Of course it is,” Bean agreed, raising a finger. “But the real question is this: Would you go into the woods?”

My mother sat very still and thoughtful for a moment.

Bean nodded. “You’d be a fool to ignore half the town’s warning, even though you don’t believe the same thing they do. If not shamble-folk, what are you afraid of?”

“Bears.”

“Bandits.”

“Good sensible fears for a trouper to have,” Bean said. “Fears that townsfolk don’t appreciate. Every place has its little superstitions, and everyone laughs at what the folk across the river think.” She gave them a serious look. “But have either of you ever heard a humorous song or story about the Chandrian? I’ll bet a penny you haven’t.”

My father shook his head after a moment’s thought. My mother took a long drink before joining him.

“Now I’m not saying that the Chandrian are out there, striking like lightning from the clear blue sky. But folk everywhere are afraid of them. There’s usually a reason for that.”

Bean grinned and tipped her clay cup, pouring the last drizzle of beer out onto the earth. “And names are strange things. Dangerous things.” She gave them a pointed look. “That I know for true because I am an educated woman. If I’m a mite superstitious too…” She shrugged. “Well, that’s my choice. I’m old. You have to humor me.”

My mother nodded thoughtfully. “It’s odd I never noticed that everyone treats the Chandrian the same. It’s something I should’ve seen.” She shook her head as if to clear it. “We can come back to names later, I suppose. What was it you wanted to talk about?”

I prepared to sneak off before I was caught, but what Bean said next froze me in place before I took a single step.

“It’s probably hard to see, being her parents and all. But your young Kvoan is rather bright.” Bean refilled her cup, and held out the jug to my mother, who declined it. “As a matter of fact, ‘bright’ doesn’t begin to cover it, not by half.”

My father watched Bean over the top of his mug. “Anyone who spends a little time with her can see that, Abena. I don’t see why anyone would make a point of it. Least of all, you.”

“I don’t think you really grasp the situation,” Bean said, stretching her feet almost into the fire. “How easily did she pick up the lute?”

My mother seemed a little surprised by the sudden change of topic. “Fairly easily, why?”

“How old was she?”

My father tugged thoughtfully at his beard for a moment. In the silence my mother’s voice was like a flute. “Eight.”

“Think back to when you learned to play. Can you remember how old you were? Can you remember the sort of difficulties you had?” My father continued to tug on his beard, but his face was more reflective now, his eyes far away.

Bean continued. “I’ll bet she learned each chord rather quick, perhaps quicker than expected.”

My mother seemed a little perturbed. “Mostly, but she did have trouble, just the same as anyone else. E chord. She had a lot of trouble with greater and diminished E.”

My father broke in softly. “I remember too, dear, but I think it was just her small hands. She was awfully young…”

“I bet it didn’t stall her for long,” Bean said quietly. “She does have marvelous hands; my mother would have called them magician’s fingers.”

My mother smiled. “She gets them from her father, delicate, but strong. Perfect for a nobleman, right dear?”

It was my father’s turn to snort, but I could see their hands intertwining despite the subtle jab. My mother leaned in to kiss the corner of his mouth, and my father put his other arm around her and gave her a squeeze. 

“I still don’t see what you’re getting at, Abena.”

“Kvoan does everything that way, quick as a whip, hardly ever makes mistakes. I’ll bet she knows every song you’ve ever sung to her. She knows more about what’s in my wagon than I do.”

She picked up the jug and uncorked it. “It’s not just memorization though. She understands. Half the things I’ve been meaning to show her she’s already figured out for herself.”

Bean refilled my mother’s cup. “She’s eleven. Have you ever known a girl her age who talks the way she does? A great deal of it comes from living in such an enlightened atmosphere.” Bean gestured to the wagons. “But most eleven-year-olds’ deepest thoughts have to do with skipping stones, and how to swing a cat by the tail.”

My mother laughed like bells, but Bean’s face was serious. “It’s true, lady. I’ve had older students that would have loved to do half as well.” She grinned. “If I had her hands, and one quarter her wit, I’d be eating off silver plates inside a year.”

There was a lull. My father spoke softly, “I remember when she was just a little baby, toddling around. Watching, always watching. With clear bright eyes that looked like they wanted to swallow up the world.” His voice had a little quaver in it. My mother put her arm around him in turn.

The next silence was longer. I was considering sneaking away when my father broke it. “What is it you suggest we do?” His voice was a mix of mild concern and fatherly pride.

Bean smiled gently. “Nothing except to think about what options you might give her when the time comes. She will leave her mark on the world as one of the best.”

“The best what?” my mother grumbled.

“Whatever she chooses. If she stays here I don’t doubt she will become the next Illien.”

My mother smiled. Illien is the troupers’ hero. The only truly famous Edema Ruh in all of history. All our oldest, best songs are her songs.

What’s more, if you believed the stories, Illien reinvented the lute in her lifetime. A master luthier, Illien transformed the archaic, fragile, unwieldy court lute into the marvelous, versatile, seven-string trouper’s lute we use today. The same stories claim Illien’s own lute had eight strings in all.

“Illien. I like that thought,” my mother said. “Royalty coming from miles away to hear my little Kvoan play.”

“Her music stopping barroom brawls and border wars.” Bean smiled.

There was a moment of thoughtful silence, after which Bean coughed and continued. “If she decides to become an arcanist, I bet she’ll have a royal appointment by the time she’s twenty-four. If she gets it into her head to be a merchant I don’t doubt she’ll own half the world by the time she dies.”

My mother’s brows knitted together. Bean smiled and said, “Don’t worry about the last one. She’s too curious for a merchant.”

Bean paused as if considering her next words very carefully. “She’d be accepted into the University, you know. Not for years, of course. Seventeen is about as young as they go, but I have no doubts about…”

I missed the rest of what Bean said. The University! I had come to think of it in the same way most children think of the Fae court, a mythical place reserved for dreaming about. A school the size of a small town. Ten times ten thousand books. People who would know the answers to any question I could ever ask…

It was quiet when I turned my attention back to them.

My father was looking down at my mother, nestled under his arm. “How about it, dear? Did you happen to bed down with some wandering philosopher a dozen years ago? That might solve our little mystery.”

She swatted at him playfully, and a thoughtful look crossed her face. “Come to think of it, there was a night, about a dozen years ago, I saw a man while in a court play. His eyes never left me as I performed, and so later that night I gave him another eyeful to bask in.” She paused, “But he didn’t have red hair. Couldn’t be him.”

She smiled wickedly at my father, who appeared a little embarrassed. Then she kissed him. He kissed her back.

That’s how I like to remember them today. I snuck away with thoughts of the University dancing in my head.
