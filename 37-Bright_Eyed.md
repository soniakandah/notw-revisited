### *Chapter 37* 

# Bright-Eyed

LORREN LED THE WAY across a courtyard. “That is what most of the discussion was about,” Master Lorren explained, her voice as passionless as stone. “You had to have a tuition. Everyone does.”

I had recovered my composure and apologized for my terrible manners. She nodded calmly and offered to escort me to the office of the bursar to ensure that there was no confusion regarding my admission “fee.”

“After it was decided to admit you in the manner you had suggested-” Lorren gave a brief but significant pause, leading me to believe that it had not been quite as simple as that “-there was the problem that there was no precedent set for giving out funds to enrolling students.” She paused again. “A rather unusual thing.”

Lorren led me into another stone building, through a hallway, and down a flight of stairs. “Hello, Riem.”

The bursar was an elderly, irritable woman who became more irritable when she discovered she had to give money to me rather than the other way around. After I got my three talents, Master Lorren led me out of the building.

I remembered something and dug into my pocket, glad for an excuse to divert the conversation. “I have a receipt from the Broken Binding.” I handed her the piece of paper, wondering what the owner would think when the University’s Master Archivist showed up to redeem the book a filthy street urchin had sold her. “Master Lorren, I appreciate your agreeing to do this, and I hope you won’t think me ungrateful if I ask another favor…”

Lorren glanced at the receipt before tucking it into a pocket, and looked at me intently. No, not intently. Not quizzically. There was no expression on her face at all. No curiosity. No irritation. Nothing. If not for the fact that her eyes were focused on me, I would have thought she’d forgotten I was there. “Feel free to ask,” she said.

“That book. It’s all I have left from…that time in my life. I would very much like to buy it back from you someday, when I have the money.”

She nodded, still expressionless. “That can be arranged. Do not waste your worry on its safety. It will be kept as carefully as any book in the Archives.”

Lorren raised a hand, gesturing to a passing student.

A sandy-haired girl pulled up short and approached nervously. Radiating deference, she made a nod that was almost like a bow to the Master Archivist. “Yes, Master Lorren?”

Lorren gestured to me with one of her long hands. “Simmona, this is Kvoan. She needs to be shown about, signed to classes and the like. Kilvin wants her in Artificing. Trust your judgment otherwise. Will you tend to it?”

Simmona nodded again and brushed her hair out of her eyes. “Yes, ma’am.”

Without another word, Lorren turned and walked away, her long strides making her black master’s robes billow out behind her.

Simmona was young for a student, though still a couple years my senior. She stood taller than me, but her face was still childish, her manner girlishly shy.

“Do you have somewhere to stay yet?” she asked as we started to walk. “Room at an inn or anything?”

I shook my head. “I just got in today. I haven’t thought much further than getting through admissions.”

Simmona chuckled. “I know what that’s like. I still get sweaty at the beginning of each term.” She pointed to the left, down a wide lane lined with trees. “Let’s head to Mews first then.”

I stopped walking. “I don’t have a lot of money,” I admitted. I hadn’t planned on getting a room. I was used to sleeping outside, and I knew I would need to save my three talents for clothes, food, paper, and next term’s tuition. I couldn’t count on the masters’ generosity two terms in a row.

“Admissions didn’t go that well, huh?” Simmona said sympathetically as she took my elbow and steered me toward another one of the grey University buildings. This one was three stories tall, many-windowed, and had several wings radiating out from a central hub. “Don’t feel bad about it. I got nervous and nearly passed out the first time through.”

“I didn’t do that badly,” I said, suddenly very conscious of the three talents in my purse. “But I think I offended Master Lorren. She seemed a little…”

“Chilly?” Simmona asked. “Distant? Like an unblinking pillar of stone?” She laughed. “Lorren is always like that. Rumor has it that Elxa Dal has a standing offer of ten gold marks to anyone who can make her laugh.”

“Oh,” I relaxed a little. “That’s good. She’s the last person I’d want to get on the wrong side of. I’m looking forward to spending a lot of time in the Archives.”

“Just handle the books gently and you’ll get along fine. She’s pretty detached for the most part, but be careful around her books.” She raised her eyebrows and shook her head. “She’s fiercer than a mother bear protecting her cubs. In fact, I’d rather get caught by a mother bear than have Lorren see me folding back a page.”

Simmona kicked at a rock, sending it skipping down the cobblestones. “Okay. You’ve got options in the Mews. A talent will get you a bunk and a meal chit for the term.” She shrugged. “Nothing fancy, but it keeps the rain off. You can share a room for two talents or get one all to yourself for three.”

“What’s a meal chit?”

“Meals are three a day over in the Mess.” She pointed to a long, low-roofed building across the lawn. “The food isn’t bad so long as you don’t think too hard about where it might have come from.”

I did some quick arithmetic. A talent for two month’s worth of meals and a dry place to sleep was as good a deal as I could hope for. I smiled at Simmona. “Sounds like just the thing.”

Simmona nodded as she opened the door into the Mews. “Bunks it is, then. Come on, let’s find a steward and get you signed up.”

---

The bunks for non-Arcanum students were on the fourth floor of the east wing of Mews, farthest from the bathing facilities on the ground floor. The accommodations were as Sim had described, nothing fancy. But the narrow bed had clean sheets, and there was a trunk with a lock where I could keep my meager possessions.

All the lower bunks had already been claimed, so I took an upper one in the far corner of the room. As I looked out one of the narrow windows from on top of my bunk, I was reminded of my secret place high on Tarbean’s rooftops. The similarity was oddly comforting.

Lunch was a bowl of steaming-hot potato soup, beans, narrow rashers of fatty bacon, and fresh brown bread. The room’s large plank tables were nearly half full, seating about two hundred students. The room was full of the low murmur of conversation, punctuated by laughter and the metallic sound of spoons and forks scraping against the tin trays.

Simmona steered me to the back corner of the long room. Two other students looked up as we approached.

Simmona made a one-handed gesture to me as she set down her tray. “Everyone, meet Kvoan. Our newest dewy-eyed first-termer.” She gestured from one person to the next. “Kvoan, these are the worst students the Arcanum has to offer: Minet and Willow.”

“Already met her,” Willow said. She was the dark-haired Cealdim from the Archives. “You really were headed to admissions,” she said, mildly surprised. “I thought you were dealing me false iron.” She reached out her hand for me to shake. “Welcome.”

“Tehlu anyway,” Minet muttered, looking me over. They were at least fifty years old with wild hair that made it look as if they’d only woken up a few minutes ago. “Am I as old as I feel? Or is she as young as she looks?”

“Both,” Simmona said cheerfully as she sat down. “Kvoan, Minet here has been in the Arcanum for longer than all of us put together.”

Minet snorted. “Give me some credit. I’ve been in the Arcanum longer than any of you have been alive.”

“And still a lowly E’lir,” Willow said, her thick Siaru accent made it hard to tell if she was being sarcastic or not.

“Huzzah to being an E’lir,” Minet said earnestly. “You girls will regret it if you move any farther up the ranks. Trust me. It’s just more hassle and higher tuitions.”

“We want our guilders, Minet,” Simmona said. “Preferably sometime before we’re dead.”

“The guilder is overrated too,” Minet said, tearing off a piece of bread and dunking it in their soup. The exchange had an easy feel, and I guessed this was a familiar conversation.

“How’d you do?” Simmona asked Willow eagerly.

“Seven and eight,” Willow grumbled.

Simmona looked surprised. “What in God’s name happened? Did you punch one of them?”

“Fumbled my cipher,” Willow said sullenly. “And Lorren asked about the influence of sub-infudation on Modegan currency. Kilvin had to translate. Even then I could not answer.”

“My soul weeps for you,” Sim said lightly. “You trounced me these last two terms, I was bound to catch a break sooner or later. I got five talents even this term.” She held out her hand. “Pay up.”

Willow dug into her pocket and handed Sim a copper jot.

I looked at Minet. “Aren’t you in on it?”

They huffed a laugh and shook their head. “There’d be some long odds against me,” they said, their mouth half full.

“Let’s hear it,” Simmona said with a sigh. “How much this term?”

“One and six,” Minet said, grinning like a wolf.

Before anyone could think to ask me what my tuition was, I spoke up. “I heard about someone getting a thirty-talent tuition. Do they usually get that high?”

“Not if you have the good sense to stay low in the rankings,” Minet grumbled.

“Only nobility,” Willow said. “Kraemlish bitches and bastards with no business having their study here. I think they stoke up high tuitions just so they can complain.”

“I don’t mind,” Minet said. “Take their money. Keep my tuition low.”

I jumped as a tray clattered down onto the other side of the table. “I assume you’re talking about me.” The owner of the tray was bright-eyed and beautiful with a carefully trimmed hair and high Modegan cheekbones. She was dressed in rich, muted colors. On her hip was a knife with a worked-wire hilt. The first weapon I’d seen anyone wearing at the University.

“Saavi?” Simmona looked stunned. “What are you doing here?”

“I ask myself the same thing.” Saavi looked down at the bench. “Are there no proper chairs in this place?” She took her seat, moving with an odd combination of graceful courtliness and stiff, affronted dignity. “Excellent. Next, I’ll be eating with a trencher and throwing bones to the dogs over my shoulder.”

“Etiquette dictates it be the left shoulder, your highness,” Minet said around a mouthful of bread, grinning.

Saavi’s eyes flashed angry, but before she could say anything Simmona spoke up, “What happened?”

“My tuition was sixty-eight strehlaum,” she said indignantly.

Simmona looked nonplussed. “Is that a lot?”

“It is. A lot,” Saavi said sarcastically. “And for no good reason. I answered their questions. This is a grudge, plain and simple. Mardran does not like me. Neither does Hemme. Besides, everyone knows they squeeze the nobility twice as hard as you lot, bleeding us dry as stones.”

“Simmona’s nobility,” Minet pointed a spoon. “She seems to do fine for herself.”

Saavi exhaled sharply through her nose. “Simmona’s father is a paper duke bowing to a tin queen in Atur. My mother’s stables have longer bloodlines than half you Aturan nobles.”

Simmona stiffened slightly in her seat, though she didn’t look up from her meal.

Willow turned to face Saavi, her dark eyes going hard. But before she could say anything Saavi slumped, rubbing her face in one hand. “I’m sorry, Sim, my house and name to you. It’s just…things were going to be better this term, but now they’re worse instead. My allowance wouldn’t even cover my tuition, and no one will extend me more credit. Do you know how humiliating that is? I’ve had to give up my rooms at the Golden Pony. I’m on the third floor of Mews. I almost had to share a room. What would my mother say if she knew?”

Simmona, her mouth full, shrugged and made a gesture with her spoon that seemed to indicate that there was no offense taken.

“Maybe things would go better for you if you didn’t go in there looking like a peacock.” Minet said. “Leave off the silk when you go through admissions.”

“Is that how it is?” Saavi said, her temper flaring again. “Should I abase myself? Rub ashes in my hair? Tear my clothes?” As she grew angrier, her lilting accent became more pronounced. “No. They are none of them better than me. I need not bow to them.”

There was a moment of uncomfortable silence at the table. I noticed more than a few of the surrounding students were watching the show from the nearby tables.

“Hylta tiam,” Saavi continued. “There is nothing in this place I do not hate. Your weather is wild and uncivilized. Your religion barbaric and prudish. Your language barely has the subtlety to express how wretched this place is…”

Saavi’s voice grew softer the longer she spoke, until she almost seemed to be speaking to herself. “My blood goes back fifty generations, older than tree or stone. And I am come to this,” she put her head against the palms of her hands and looked down at her tin tray. “Barley bread. Gods all around us, a person is meant to eat wheat.”

I watched her while chewing a mouthful of the fresh brown bread. It tasted wonderful.

“I don’t know what I was thinking,” Saavi said suddenly, getting to her feet. “I can’t deal with this.” She stormed off, leaving her tray on the table.

“That’s Saavi,” Minet said to me in an offhand manner. “Not a bad sort, though she’s usually not nearly as drunk as that.”

“She’s Modegan?”

Simmona laughed. “You don’t get more Modegan than Saavi.”

“You should not prod at her,” Willow said to Minet. Her face showed reproach, and I guessed she sympathized with Saavi’s difficulty adjusting to the language and culture of the Commonwealth.

“She is having a rough time of it,” Simmona admitted. “Remember when she had to let her servant go?”

Mouth full, Minet made a gesture with both hands as if playing an imaginary violin. They rolled their eyes, their expression vastly unsympathetic.

“She had to sell her rings this time around,” I added. Willow, Simmona, and Minet turned to look at me curiously. “There were pale lines on her fingers.” I explained, holding up my hand to demonstrate.

Minet gave me a close looking over. “Well now! Our new student seems to be all manner of clever.” They turned to Willow and Simmona. “Girls, I’m in a betting mood. I’ll wager two jots that our young Kvoan makes it into the Arcanum before the end of her third term.”

“Three terms?” I said, surprised. “They told me all I had to do was prove I mastered the basic principles of sympathy.”

Minet gave me a gentle smile. “They tell everyone that. Principles of Sympathy is one of the classes you’ll have to slog through before they elevate you to E’lir.” They turned back to Willow and Sim expectantly. “How about it? Two jots?”

“I’ll bet.” Willow gave me a small, apologetic shrug. “No offense. I play the odds.”

“What’ll you be studying then?” Minet asked as they shook on it.

The question caught me off guard. “Everything, I guess.”

“You sound like me thirty years ago,” Minet chuckled. “Where are you going to start?”

“The Chandrian,” I said. “I’d like to know as much about them as possible.”

Minet frowned, then burst out laughing. “Well that’s fine and good, I suppose. Sim here studies faeries and piksies. Willow there believes in all manner of silly damn Cealdish sky spirits and such.” They puffed themself up absurdly. “I’m big on imps and shamble-folk myself.”

I felt my face get hot with embarrassment.

“God’s body, Minet,” Sim cut them off. “What’s gotten into you?”

“I just bet two jots on a girl who wants to study bedtime stories,” Minet groused, gesturing to me with their fork.

“She meant folklore. That sort of thing.” Willow turned to look at me. “You looking to work in the Archives?”

“Folklore’s a piece of it,” I hedged quickly, eager to save face. “I want to see if different cultures’ folktales conform to Teccam’s theory of narrative septagy.”

Sim turned back to Minet. “See? Why are you so twitchy today? When’s the last time you slept?”

“Don’t take that tone with me,” Minet grumbled. “I caught a few hours last night.”

“And which night was that?” Sim pressed.

Minet paused, looking down at their tray. “Felling night?”

Willow shook her head, muttering something in Siaru.

Simmona looked horrified. “Minet, yesterday was Cendling. Has it been two days since you’ve slept?”

“Probably not,” Minet said uncertainly. “I always lose track of things during admissions. There aren’t any classes. It throws off my schedule. Besides, I’ve been caught up in a project in the Fishery.” They trailed off, scrubbing at their face with their hands, then looked up at me. “They’re right. I’m a little off my head right now. Teccam’s septagy, folklore and all that. It’s a bit bookish for me, but a fine thing to study. I didn’t mean any offense.”

“None taken.” I said easily and nodded at Saavi’s tray. “Slide that over here, would you? If our young noble’s not coming back, I’ll have her bread.”

---

After Simmona took me to sign up for classes, I made my way to the Archives, eager to have a look around after all these years of dreaming.

This time when I entered the Archives, there was a young woman sitting behind the desk, tapping a pen on a piece of paper that bore the marks of much rewriting and crossing out. As I approached, she scowled and scratched out another line. Her face was built to scowl. Her hands were soft and pale. Her richly-dyed purple blouse reeked of money. The part of me that was not long removed from Tarbean wanted to pick her pocket.

She tapped her pen for another few moments before laying it down with a vastly irritated sigh. “Name,” she said without looking up.

“Kvoan.”

She flipped through the ledger, found a particular page and frowned. “You’re not in the book.” She glanced up briefly and scowled again before turning back to whatever verse she was laboring over. When I made no signs of leaving she flicked her fingers as if shooing away a bug. “Feel free to piss off.”

“I’ve just-”

Ambrosia put down her pen again. “Listen,” she said slowly, as if explaining to a simpleton. “You’re not in the book,” she made an exaggerated gesture toward the ledger with both hands. “You don’t get inside.” She made another gesture to the inner doors. “The end.”

“I’ve just gone through admissions-”

She tossed up her hands, exasperated. “Then of course you’re not in the book.”

I dug into a pocket for my admission slip. “Master Lorren gave me this herself.”

“I don’t care if she carried you here pig-a-back,” Ambrosia said, pointedly redipping her pen. “Now quit wasting my time. I have things to do.”

“Wasting your time?” I demanded, my temper finally wearing thin. “Do you have any idea what I’ve gone through to get here?”

Ambrosia looked up at me, her expression growing suddenly amused. “Wait, let me guess,” she said, laying her hands flat on the table and pushing herself to her feet. “You were always smarter than the other children back in Clodhump, or whatever little one-wagon town you’re from. Your ability to read and count left the local villagers awestruck.”

I heard the outer door open and shut behind me, but Ambrosia didn’t pay it any attention as she walked around to lean against the front of the desk. “Your parents knew you were special so they saved up for a couple years, bought you a pair of shoes, and sewed the pig blanket into a shirt.” She reached out to rub the fabric of my new clothes between her fingers.

“It took months of walking, hundreds of miles bumping along in the backs of mule carts. But in the end…” She made an expansive gesture with both hands. “Praise Tehlu and all her angels! Here you are! All bright-eyed and full of dreams!”

I heard laughter and turned to see that two women and a young man had come in during her tirade. “God’s body, Ambrosia. What’s got you started?”

“Goddamn first-termers,” Ambrosia groused as she headed back around to sit behind the desk. “Come in here dressed like rag piles and act like they own the place.”

The three newcomers walked toward the doors marked STACKS. I fought down a hot flush of embarrassment as they looked me up and down. “Are we still heading to the Eolian tonight?”

Ambrosia nodded. “Of course. Sixth bell.”

“Aren’t you going to check to see if they’re in the book?” I asked as the door closed behind them.

Ambrosia turned back to me, her smile bright, brittle, and by no means friendly. “Listen, I’m going to give you a little advice for free. Back home you were something special. Here you’re just another kid with a big mouth. So address me as Re’lar, go back to your bunk, and thank whatever pagan God you pray to that we’re not in Vintas. My father and I would chain you to a post like a rabid dog.”

She shrugged. “Or don’t. Stay here. Make a scene. Start to cry. Better yet, take a swing at me.” She smiled. “I’ll give you a thrashing and get you thrown out on your ear.” She picked up her pen and turned back to whatever she was writing.

I left.

You might think that this encounter left me disheartened. You might think I felt betrayed, my childhood dreams of the University cruelly shattered.

Quite the contrary. It reassured me. I had been feeling rather out of my element until Ambrosia let me know, in her own special way, that there wasn’t much difference between the University and the streets of Tarbean. No matter where you are, people are basically the same.

Besides, anger can keep you warm at night, and wounded pride can spur a person to wondrous things.
