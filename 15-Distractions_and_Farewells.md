### *Chapter 15*

# Distractions and Farewells

THE TOWN WAS CALLED Hallowfell. We stopped for a handful of days because there was a good wainwright there, and nearly all our wagons needed tending or mending of some sort. While we were waiting, Bean got an offer she couldn’t refuse.

It was from an old widower, a fairly wealthy man who owned a brewery that was getting difficult to run as the years went on. This brewery was where Bean spent her evenings,  and it seemed as if her time there renewed a spark in her eyes that I had never seen before. 

Nearing the end of our time in Hallowfell, Bean told the troupe that she was staying. The widower had offered her the brewery to run, and, by the look of Bean’s flushed cheeks, perhaps something more. As you can see, I don’t think anyone could have built a better snare for Bean if they had tried.

Plans were changed and the troupe stayed on at Hallowfell for a few extra days. My twelfth birthday was moved up and combined with Bean’s going away party.

To truly understand what it was like, you must realize that nothing is so grand as a troupe showing off for one another. Good entertainers try to make each performance seem special, but you need to remember that the show they’re putting on for you is the same one they’ve put on for hundreds of other audiences. Even the most dedicated troupes have an occasional lackluster performance, especially when they know they can get away with it.

Small towns, rural inns, those places didn’t know good entertainment from bad. Your fellow performers did.

Think then, how do you entertain the people who have seen your act a thousand times? You dust off the old tricks. You try out some new ones. You hope for the best. And, of course, the grand failures are as entertaining as the great successes.

I remember the evening as a wonderful blur of warm emotion, tinged in bitter. Fiddles, lutes, and drums, everyone played and danced and sang as they wished. I dare say we rivaled any faerie revel you can bring to mind.

I got presents. Trip gave me a belt knife with a leather grip, claiming that all children should have something they can hurt themselves with. Shandi gave me a lovely cloak she had made, scattered with little pockets for a child’s treasures. My parents gave me a lute, a beautiful thing of smooth dark wood. I had to play a song of course, and Bean sang with me. I slipped a little on the strings of the unfamiliar instrument, and Bean wandered off looking for notes once or twice, but it was nice.

Bean opened up a small keg of mead she had been saving for “just such an occasion.” I remember it tasting the way I felt, sweet and bitter and sullen.

Several people had collaborated to write “The Ballad of Bean, Brewer Supreme.” My mother recited it as gravely as if it were the Modegan royal lineage while accompanying herself on a half harp. Everyone laughed until they hurt, and Bean twice as much as everyone else.

At some point in the night, my mother swept me up and danced around in a great spinning circle. Her laughter sang out like music trailing in the wind. Her hair and skirt spun around me as she twirled. She smelled comforting, the way only mothers do. That smell, and the quick laughing kiss she gave me did more to ease the dull ache of Bean’s leaving than all the entertainments combined.

Trip and Teren staged a mock sword fight that was one part breathtaking swordplay, one part dramatic soliloquy (provided by Teren), and one part buffoonery that I’m sure Trip must have invented on the spot. It ranged all over the camp. In the course of the fight Trip managed to break his sword, hide under a lady’s dress, fence with a sausage, and perform such fantastical acrobatics that it’s a miracle he didn’t seriously injure himself. Although he did split his pants up the back.

Daxy set herself alight while attempting a spectacular bit of fire breathing and had to be doused. All she suffered was a bit of singed hair and a slightly bruised pride. She recovered quickly under Bean’s tender ministrations, a mug of mead, and a reminder that not everyone was cut out to have eyebrows.

My parents sang “The Lay of Sir Savien Traliard.” Like most of the great songs, Sir Savien was written by Illien, and generally considered to be her crowning work.

It’s a beautiful song, made more so by the fact that I’d only heard my mother perform the whole thing a handful of times before. It’s hellishly complex, and my mother was probably the only one in the troupe who could do it justice. Though she didn’t particularly show it, I knew it was taxing even for her. My father sang the counter-harmony, his voice soft and lilting. Even the fire seemed subdued when they took a breath. I felt my heart lift and dive. I wept as much for the glory of two voices so perfectly enmeshed as for the tragedy of the song.

Yes, I cried at the end of it. I did then, and I have every time since. Even a reading of the story aloud will bring tears to my eyes. In my opinion, anyone who isn’t moved by it is less than human inside.

There was a momentary quiet after they finished, wherein everyone wiped their eyes and blew their noses . Then, after a suitable period of recovery had elapsed, someone called out, “Lanre! Lanre!”

The shout was taken up by several other people. “Yes, Lanre!”

My mother gave a wry smile and shook her head. She never performed any part of a song until it was finished.

“C’mon, Arla!” Shandi called out. “You’ve been stewing it long enough. Let some out of the pot.”

She shook her head again, still smiling. “It’s not ready yet.” She bent down and carefully set her lute into its case.

“Let’s have a taste, Arladay.” It was Teren this time.

“Yeah, for Bean’s sake. It’s not fair that she should have to hear you mumble over it for all this while and not get…”

“…are wondering what you’re doing in that wagon with your husband if it’s not…”

“Sing it!”

“Lanre!”

Trip quickly organized the whole troupe into a great chanting, howling mass that my mother managed to withstand for almost a minute before she stooped and lifted her lute back out of the case. Everyone cheered.

The crowd hushed as soon as she sat back down. She tuned a string or two, even though she’d only just set it down. She flexed her fingers and struck a few soft, experimental notes, then swept into the song so gently that I caught myself listening to it before I knew it had begun. Then my mother’s voice spoke over the rise and fall of the music.

“Sit and listen all, for I will sing
A story, wrought and forgotten in a time
Old and gone. A story of a woman.
Proud Lanre, strong as the spring.

Steel of the sword she had at ready hand.
Hear how she fought, fell, and rose again,
To fall again. Under shadow falling then.
Love felled her, love for native land.

And love of her dear Lyra, at whose calling
Some say she rose, through doors of death
To speak her name as her first reborn breath.”

My mother drew a breath and paused, her mouth open as if she would continue. Then a wide, wicked grin spread across her face and she bent to tuck her lute safely away. There was an outcry and a great deal of complaining, but everyone knew they had been lucky to hear as much as they had. Someone else struck up a song for dancing, and the protests faded away.

My parents danced together, her head on his chest. Both had their eyes closed. They seemed so perfectly content. If you can find someone like that, someone who you can hold and close your eyes to the world with, then you’re lucky. Even if it only lasts for a minute or a day. The image of them gently swaying to the music is how I picture love in my mind even after all these years.

Afterward, Bean danced in turn with every member of the troupe, her steps sure and stately. I ached knowing I might never see her again.

By this time the sky was beginning to brighten in the east. Everyone gathered to say their final good-byes.

I can’t remember what I said to her before we left. I know it felt woefully inadequate, but I knew she understood. She made me promise not to get myself into any trouble, tinkering with the things she had taught me.

She stooped a bit and gave me a hug, then tousled my hair. I didn’t even mind. In semi-retaliation I tried to smooth out her eyebrows, something I’d always wanted to try.

Her expression was marvelous in its surprise. She gathered me into another hug. Then she stepped away.

My parents promised to steer the troupe back toward the town when we were in the area. All the troupers said they wouldn’t need much steering. But, even as young as I was, I knew the truth. It would be a great long time before I saw her again. Years.

I don’t remember starting out that morning, but I do remember trying to sleep and feeling quite alone except for a dull, bittersweet ache.

When I awoke later in the afternoon I found a package resting next to me. Wrapped in sackcloth and tied with twine, there was a bright piece of paper with my name fixed to the top, waving in the wind like a little flag.

Unwrapping it, I recognized the book’s binding. It was Rhetoric and Logic, the book Bean had used to teach me argument. Out of her small library of a dozen books it was the only one I hadn’t read from cover to cover. I hated it.

I cracked it open and saw writing on the inside cover. It said:

“Kvoan,

Defend yourself well at the University. Make me proud.
Remember your mother’s song. Be wary of folly.

Your friend,
Abena.”

Bean and I had never discussed my attending the University. Of course I had dreams of going there, someday. But they were dreams I hesitated to share with my parents. Attending the University would mean leaving my parents, my troupe, everyone and everything I had ever known.

Quite frankly, the thought was terrifying. What would it be like to settle in one place, not just for an evening or a span of days, but for months? Years? No more performing? No tumbling with Trip, or playing the bratty young noble’s daughter in Three Pennies for Wishing? No more wagons? No one to sing with?

I’d never said anything aloud, but Bean would have guessed. I read her inscription again, cried a bit, and promised her that I would do my best.
