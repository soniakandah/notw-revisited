### *Chapter 23* 
# The Burning Wheel

I STAYED TUCKED INTO my secret place all that night and woke late the next day to find my body had stiffened into a tight knot of pain. Since I still had food and a little wine I stayed where I was rather than risk falling when I tried to climb down to the street.

It was a sunless day with a damp wind that never seemed to stop. Sleet gusted under the protection of the overhanging roof. The chimney was warm behind me, but it wasn’t enough to actually dry out my blanket or drive away the chilly damp that soaked my clothes.

I finished the wine and the bread early on, and after that I spent most of my time gnawing at the turkey bones and trying to warm up snow in the empty wine flask so I could drink it. Neither proved very productive, and I ended up eating mouthfuls of slushy snow that left me shivering with the taste of tar in my mouth.

Despite my injuries I dropped off to sleep in the afternoon and woke late at night filled with the most wonderful warmth. I pushed away my blanket and rolled away from the now too-hot chimney only to wake near dawn, shivering and soaked through to the skin. I felt strange, dizzy and fuddled. I huddled back against the chimney and spent the rest of the day drifting in and out of a restless, fevered sleep.

I have no memory of how I made it off the rooftop, delirious with fever and nearly crippled. I don’t remember making my way the three-quarters of a mile through Tallows and the Crates. I only remember falling down the stairs that led to Tris’ basement, my purse of money clutched tight in my hand. As I lay there shivering and sweating I heard the faint slapping of her bare feet on the stone.

“What what,” she said gently as she picked me up. “Hush hush.”

Tris nursed me through the long days of my fever. She wrapped me in blankets, fed me, and when my fever showed no signs of breaking on its own, she used the money I’d brought to buy a bittersweet medicine. She kept my face and hands wet and cool while murmuring her patient, gentle, “What what. Hush hush,” while I cried out from endless fever dreams of my dead parents, the Chandrian, and a woman with empty eyes.

I woke clear-headed and cool.

“Oooohreeee,” Tanee said loudly from where they were tied to their cot.

“What what. Hush hush, Tanee.” Tris said as she put down one of the babies and picked up the other. It looked around owlishly with wide, dark eyes, but seemed unable to support its own head. It was quiet in the room.

“Ooooooohreeee,” Tanee said again.

I coughed, trying to clear my throat.

“There’s a cup on the floor next to you,” Tris said, brushing a hand along the head of the baby she held.

“OOOOOH OOHRRRREE EEEEEEHHAA!” Tanee bellowed, strange half-gasps punctuating their cry. The noise agitated several of the others who moved restlessly in their cots. A boy sitting in the corner raised his hands to the sides of his head and began to moan. He started rocking back and forth, gently at first, but then more and more violently so that when he came forward his head knocked against the bare stone of the wall.

Tris was at his side before the boy could do himself any real harm. She put her arms around the rocking boy. “Hush hush, Loni. Hush hush.” The boy’s rocking slowed but did not entirely subside. “Tanee, you know better than to make all that noise.” Her voice was serious, but not stern. “Why are you making trouble? Loni could hurt himself.”

“Oorrahee,” Tanee said softly. I thought I could detect a note of remorse in their voice.

“I think they want a story,” I said, surprising myself by speaking.

“Aaaa,” Tanee said.

“Is that what you want, Tanee?”

“Aaaa.”

There was a quiet moment. “I don’t know any stories,” she said.

Tanee remained stubbornly silent.

Everyone knows one story, I thought. Everyone knows at least one.

“Ooooooree!”

Tris looked around at the quiet room, as if looking for an excuse. “Well,” she said reluctantly. “It has been a while since we had a story, hasn’t it?” She looked down at the boy in her arms. “Would you like a story, Loni?”

Loni nodded a violent affirmation, nearly battering Tris’ cheek with the back of his head.

“Will you be good and sit by yourself, so I can tell a story?”

Loni stopped rocking almost immediately. Tris slowly unwrapped her arms and stepped away. After a long look to make sure the boy wouldn’t hurt himself, she stepped carefully back to her chair.

“Well,” she muttered softly to herself as she stooped to pick up the baby she had set aside. “Do I have a story?” She spoke very quietly to the child’s wide eyes. “No. No, I don’t. Can I remember one? I suppose I had better.”

She sat for a long moment, humming to the child in her arms, a thoughtful expression on her face. “Yes, of course.” She sat up taller in her chair. “Are you ready?”

---

This is a story from long ago. Back before any of us were born. Before our mothers and fathers were born, too. It was a long time ago. Maybe...maybe four hundred years. No, more than that. Probably a thousand years. But maybe not quite as much as that.

It was a bad time in the world. People were hungry and sick. There were famines and great plagues. There were many wars and other bad things in this time, because there was no one to stop them.

But the worst thing in this time was that there were demons walking the land. Some of them were small and troublesome, creatures who lamed horses and spoiled milk. But there were many worse than those.

There were demons who hid in folk’s bodies and made them sick or mad, but those were not the worst. There were demons like great beasts that would catch and eat people while they were still alive and screaming, but they were not the worst. Some demons stole the skins of people and wore them like clothes, but even they were not the worst.

There was one demon that stood above the others. Encanis, the swallowing darkness. No matter where she walked, shadows hid her face, and scorpions that stung her died of the corruption they had touched.

Now Tehlu, who made the world and who is lady over all, watched the world. She saw that demons made sport of us and killed us and ate our bodies. Some folk she saved, but only a few. For Tehlu is just and saves only the worthy, and in these times few folk acted even for their own good, let alone the good of others.

Because of this, Tehlu was unhappy. For she had made the world to be a good place for people to live. But her church was corrupt. They stole from the poor and did not live by the laws she had given…

No, wait. There was no church yet, and no priests either. Just men and women, and some of them knew who Tehlu was. But even those were wicked, so when they called on Lady Tehlu for help she felt no desire to aid them.

But after years of watching and waiting, Tehlu saw a man pure of heart and spirit. His name was Perial. His mother had raised him to know Tehlu, and he worshiped her as well as his poor circumstances allowed. Although his own life was hard, Perial prayed only for others, and never for himself.

Tehlu watched him for long years. She saw his life was hard, full of misfortune and torment at the hands of demons and bad people. But he never cursed her name or ceased his praying, and he never treated any person other than with kindness and respect.

So late one night, Tehlu went to him in a dream. She stood before him, and seemed to be made entirely of fire or sunlight. She came to him in splendor and asked him if he knew who she was.

“Sure enough,” he said. You see, he was very calm about it because he thought he was just having an odd dream. “You’re Lady Tehlu.”

She nodded and asked him if he knew why she had come to him.

“Are you going to do something for my neighbor Debran?” he asked. Because that’s who he had prayed for before he went to sleep. “Are you going to lay your hand on him and heal his broken leg and stubborn heart? He fights all medicine and calls only for your name.”

Tehlu knew his neighbors. She knew they were wicked people who had done wicked things. Everyone in the village was wicked but him. Everyone in the world was. She told him so.

“Debran has been very kind and good to me,” Perial said. “And even Losel, who I don’t care for, is one of my neighbors all the same.”

Tehlu told him that Debran spent time in many different women’s beds, and Losel drank every day of the week, even on Mourning. No, wait-there wasn’t any Mourning yet. But she drank a lot at any rate. Sometimes she grew so loud and boorish that no alehouse would allow her patronage.

Perial was quiet for a long moment in his dream. He knew Tehlu spoke the truth, he knew his neighbors did the things Tehlu said. Even so, he cared for them all the same. “You won’t help?”

Tehlu said that their ailments were fitting of their misdeeds. They were wicked and the wicked should be punished.

Perial spoke out honestly, perhaps because he thought he was dreaming, but perhaps he would have said the same thing had he been awake, for Perial said what was in his heart. “It’s not their fault that the world is full of hard choices and hunger and loneliness,” he said. “What can you expect of people when demons are their neighbors?”

But though Tehlu listened to his wise words with her ears, she told him that humankind was wicked, and the wicked should be punished.

“I think you know very little about what it is to be a human,” Perial replied. “And I would still help them if I could,” he told her resolutely.

SO YOU SHALL, Tehlu told him, and reached out to lay her hand on his heart. When she touched him he felt like he were a great golden bell that had just rung out its first note. He opened his eyes and knew then that it had been no normal dream.

In his arms was a new-born babe, wrapped in the finest linens you had ever seen. It was a baby girl, and he named her Menda. The day after, Menda no longer needed to be held and could crawl on her own. In two days she could walk. Perial was surprised, but not worried, for he knew the child was a gift from God.

Nevertheless, Perial was wise. He knew that people might not understand. So he kept Menda close by him, and when his friends and neighbors came to visit, he sent them away.

But this could only last a little while, for in a small town there are no secrets. Folk knew that Perial was not married. And while children born out of wedlock were common during this time, children who grew to adulthood in less than two months were not. They were afraid that he might have stolen a demon spawn; such things were not unheard of in those dark times, and the people were afraid.

So everyone gathered together on the first day of the seventh span, and made their way to the tiny house where Perial lived by himself with his newfound child. The town smith, whose name was Renn, led them. “Show us the girl,” she yelled. But there was no response from the house. “Bring out the girl, and show us she is nothing but a human child.”

The house remained quiet, and though there were many folk among them, no one wanted to enter a house that might have a demon’s child inside. So the smith cried out again, “Perial, bring out young Menda, or we will burn your house around you.”

The door opened, and a woman stepped out. None of them recognized who it was, because even though she was only seven span old, Menda looked to be a young woman of seventeen. She stood proud and tall, with coal-black hair and eyes. “I am the one you think is Menda,” she said in a voice both powerful and deep. “What do you want of me?”

The sound of her voice made Perial gasp inside the cottage. Not only was this the first time Menda had ever spoken, but he recognized her voice as the same one that had spoken to him in a dream, months ago.

“What do you mean, we think you are Menda?” asked the smith, gripping her hammer tightly. She knew that there were demons that looked human, or wore human skins like costumes, the way a person might hide beneath a sheepskin.

The child who was not a child spoke again. “I am Perial’s daughter, but I am not Menda. And I am not a demon.”

“Touch the iron of my hammer then,” said Renn, for she knew all demons feared two things, cold iron and clean fire. She held out her heavy forge hammer. It shook in her hands, but no one thought the less of her for it.

She who was not Menda stepped forward and lay both hands on the iron head of the hammer. Nothing happened. From the doorway of his house where he watched, Perial burst into tears, for though he trusted Tehlu, some part of him had held a fathers’s worry for his daughter.

“I am not Menda, though that is what my father called me. I am Tehlu, lady above all. I have come to free you from demons and the wickedness of your own hearts. I am Tehlu, daughter of myself. Let the wicked hear my voice and tremble.”

And they did tremble. But some of them refused to believe. They called her a demon and threatened her. They spoke hard, frightened words. Some threw stones and cursed her, and spat toward her and her father.

Then Tehlu grew angry, and she might have slain them all, but Perial leaped forward and laid a restraining hand on her shoulder. “What more can you expect?” he asked her quietly. “From folk who live with demons for their neighbors? Even the best dog will bite that has been kicked enough.”

Tehlu considered his words and saw that he was wise. So she looked over her hands at Renn, looked deep into her heart and said, “Renn, daughter of Ema. Folk come to you for work and you cheat or steal from them. And though you pray loudly, you do not believe I, Tehlu, made the world and watch over all who live here.”

When Renn heard this, she grew pale and dropped her hammer to the ground. For what Tehlu said to her was true. Tehlu looked at all the people gathered there. She looked into their hearts and spoke of what she saw. All of them were wicked, so much that Renn was among the best of them.

Then Tehlu drew a line in the dirt of the road so that it lay between herself and all those who had come. “This road is like the meandering course of a life. There are two paths to take, side by side. Each of you are already traveling that side. You must choose. Stay on your own path, or cross to mine.”

“But the road is the same, isn’t it? It still goes to the same place,” someone asked.

“Yes.”

“Where does the road lead?”

“Death. All lives end in death, excepting one. Such is the way of things.”

“Then what does it matter which side a person is on?” It was Renn asking these questions. She was a large woman, one of the few that was taller than dark-eyed Tehlu. But she was shaken by all that she had seen and heard in the past few hours. “What is on our side of the road?”

“Pain,” Tehlu said in a voice as hard and cold as stone. “Punishment.”

“And your side?”

“Pain now,” Tehlu said in the same voice. “Punishment now, for all that you have done. It cannot be avoided. But I am here too, this is my path.”

“How do I cross?”

“Regret, repent, and cross to me.”

Renn stepped over the line to stand beside her God. Then Tehlu bent to pick up the hammer that the smith had dropped. But instead of giving it back, she struck Renn with it as if it were a lash. Once. Twice. Thrice. And the third blow sent Renn to her knees sobbing and crying out in pain. But after the third blow, Tehlu laid the hammer aside and knelt to look Renn in the face. “You were the first to cross,” she said softly so only the smith could hear. “It was a brave thing, a hard thing to do. I am proud of you. You are no longer Renn, now you are Weren, the forger of the path.” Then Tehlu embraced her with both arms, and her touch took much of the pain from Renn who was now Weren. But not all, for Tehlu spoke truly when she said that punishment cannot be avoided.

One by one they crossed, and one by one Tehlu struck them down with the hammer. But after each person fell, Tehlu knelt and spoke to them, giving them new names and healing some of their hurt.

Many of them had demons hiding inside them that fled screaming when the hammer touched them. These people Tehlu spoke with a while longer, but she always embraced them in the end, and they were all grateful. Some of them danced for the joy of being free of such terrible things living inside them.

In the end, seven stayed on the other side of the line. Tehlu asked them three times if they would cross, and three times they refused. After the third asking Tehlu sprang across the line and she struck each of them a great blow, driving them to the ground.

But not all were human. When Tehlu struck the fourth, there was the sound of quenching iron and the smell of burning leather. For the fourth person had not been a person at all, but a demon wearing a man’s skin. When it was revealed, Tehlu grabbed the demon and broke it in her hands, cursing its name and sending it back to the outer darkness that is the home of its kind.

The remaining three let themselves be struck down. None of them were demons, though demons fled the bodies of some who fell. After she was done, Tehlu did not speak to the six who did not cross, nor did she kneel to embrace them and ease their wounds.

The next day, Tehlu set off to finish what she had begun. She walked from town to town, offering each village she met the same choice she had given before. Always the results were the same, some crossed, some stayed, some were not people at all but demons, and those she destroyed.

But there was one demon who eluded Tehlu. Encanis, whose face was all in shadow. Encanis, whose voice was like a knife in the minds of people.

Wherever Tehlu stopped to offer folk the choice of path, Encanis had been there just before, killing crops and poisoning wells. Encanis, setting folk to murder one another and stealing children from their beds at night.

At the end of seven years, Tehlu’s feet had carried her all through the world. She had driven out the demons that plagued us. All but one. Encanis ran free and did the work of a thousand demons, destroying and despoiling wherever she went.

So Tehlu chased and Encanis fled. Soon Tehlu was a span of days behind the demon, then two days, then half a day. Finally she was so close she felt the chill of Encanis’ passing and could spy places where she had set her hands and feet, for they were marked with a cold, black frost.

Knowing she was pursued, Encanis came to a great city. The Lady of Demons called forth her power and the city was brought to ruin. She did this hoping Tehlu would delay so she could make her escape, but the Walking God paused only to appoint priests who cared for the people of the ruined town.

For six days Encanis fled, and six great cities she destroyed. But on the seventh day, Tehlu drew near before Encanis could bring her power to bear and the seventh city was saved. That is why seven is a lucky number, and why we celebrate on Caenin.

Encanis was now hard pressed and bent her whole thought upon escape. But on the eighth day Tehlu did not pause to sleep or eat. And thus it was that at the end of Felling Tehlu caught Encanis. She leaped on the demon and struck her with her forge hammer. Encanis fell like a stone, but Tehlu’s hammer shattered and lay in the dust of the road.

Tehlu carried the demon’s limp body all through the long night, and on the morning of the ninth day she came to the city of Atur. When folk saw Tehlu carrying the demon’s senseless form, they thought Encanis dead. But Tehlu knew that such a thing was not easily done. No simple blade or blow could kill her. No cell of bars could keep her safe within.

So Tehlu carried Encanis to the smithy. She called for iron, and people brought all they owned. Though she had taken no rest nor a morsel of food, all through the ninth day Tehlu labored. While ten people worked the bellows, Tehlu forged the great iron wheel.

All night she worked, and when the first light of the tenth morning touched her, Tehlu struck the wheel one final time and it was finished. Wrought all of black iron, the wheel stood taller than a person. It had six spokes, each thicker than a hammer’s haft, and its rim was a handspan across. It weighed as much as forty people, and was cold to the touch. The sound of its name was terrible, and none could speak it.

Tehlu gathered the people who were watching and chose a priest among them. Then she set them to dig a great pit in the center of the town, fifteen feet wide and twenty feet deep.

With the sun rising Tehlu laid the body of the demon on the wheel. At the first touch of iron, Encanis began to stir in her sleep. But Tehlu chained her tightly to the wheel, hammering the links together, sealing them tighter than any lock.

Then Tehlu stepped back, and all saw Encanis shift again, as if disturbed by an unpleasant dream. Then she shook and came awake entirely. Encanis strained against the chains, her body arching upward as she pulled against them. Where the iron touched her skin it felt like knives and needles and nails, like the searing pain of frost, like the sting of a hundred biting flies. Encanis thrashed on the wheel and began to howl as the iron burned and bit and froze her.

To Tehlu the sound was like sweet music. She lay down on the ground beside the wheel and slept a deep sleep, for she was very tired.

When she awoke, it was evening of the tenth day. Encanis was still bound to the wheel, but she no longer howled and fought like a trapped animal. Tehlu bent and with great effort lifted one edge of the wheel and set it leaning against a tree that grew nearby. As soon as she came close, Encanis cursed her in languages no one knew, scratching and biting.

“You brought this on yourself,” Tehlu said.

That night there was a celebration. Tehlu sent people to cut a dozen evergreens and use them to kindle a bonfire in the bottom of the deep pit they had dug.

All night the townsfolk danced and sang around the burning fire. They knew the last and most dangerous of the world’s demons was finally caught.

And all night Encanis hung from her wheel and watched them, motionless as a snake.

When the morning of the eleventh day came, Tehlu went to Encanis a third and final time. The demon looked worn and feral. Her skin was sallow and her bones pressed tight against her skin. But her power still lay around her like a dark mantle, hiding her face in shadow.

“Encanis,” Tehlu said. “This is your last chance to speak. Do it, for I know it is within your power.”

“Lady Tehlu, I am not Encanis.” For that brief moment the demon’s voice was pitiful, and all who heard it were moved to sorrow. But then there was a sound like quenching iron, and the wheel rung like an iron bell. Encanis’ body arched painfully at the sound, then hung limply from her wrists as the ringing of the wheel faded.

“Try no tricks, dark one. Speak no lies,” Tehlu said sternly, her eyes as dark and hard as the iron of the wheel.

“What then?” Encanis hissed, her voice like the rasp of stone on stone. “What? Rack and shatter you, what do you want of me?”

“Your road is very short, Encanis. But you may still choose a side on which to travel.”

Encanis laughed. “You will give me the same choice you give the cattle? Yes then, I will cross to your side of the path, I regret and rep-”

The wheel rung again, like a great bell tolling long and deep. Encanis threw her body tight against the chains again and the sound of her scream shook the earth and shattered stones for half a mile in each direction.

When the sounds of wheel and scream had faded, Encanis hung panting and shaking from her chains. “I told you to speak no lie, Encanis,” Tehlu said, pitiless.

“My path then!” Encanis shrieked. “I do not regret! If I had my choice again, I would only change how fast I ran. Your people are like cattle my kind feed on! Bite and break you, if you gave me half an hour I would do such things that these wretched gawping peasants would go mad with fear. I would drink their children’s blood and bathe in their tears.” She might have said more, but her breath was short as she strained against the chains that held her.

“So,” Tehlu said, and stepped close to the wheel. For a moment it seemed like she would embrace Encanis, but she was merely reaching for the iron spokes of the wheel. Then, straining, Tehlu lifted the wheel above her head. She carried it, arms upstretched, toward the pit, and threw Encanis in.

Through the long hours of night, a dozen evergreens had fed the fire. The flames had died in the early morning, leaving a deep bed of sullen coals that glimmered when the wind brushed them.

The wheel struck flat, with Encanis on top. There was an explosion of spark and ash as it landed and sank inches deep into the hot coals. Encanis was held over the coals by the iron that bound and burned and bit at her.

Though she was held away from the fire itself, the heat was so intense that Encanis’ clothes charred black and began to crumble without bursting into flame. The demon thrashed against her bonds, settling the wheel more firmly into the coals. Encanis screamed, because she knew that even demons can die from fire or iron. And though she was powerful, she was bound and burning. She felt the metal of the wheel grow hot beneath her, blackening the flesh of her arms and legs. Encanis screamed, and even as her skin began to smoke and char, her face was still hidden in a shadow that rose from her like a tongue of darkening flame.

Then Encanis grew silent, and the only sound was the hiss of sweat and blood as they fell from the demon’s straining limbs. For a long moment everything was still. Encanis strained against the chains that held her to the wheel, and it seemed that she would strain until her muscles tore themselves from bone and sinew both.

Then there was a sharp sound like a bell breaking and the demon’s arm jerked free of the wheel. Links of chain, now glowing red from the heat of the fire, flew upward to land smoking at the feet of those who stood above. The only sound was the sudden, wild laughter of Encanis, like breaking glass.

In a moment the demon’s second hand was free, but before she could do more, Tehlu flung herself into the pit and landed with such force that the iron rang with it. Tehlu grabbed the hands of the demon and pressed them back against the wheel.

Encanis screamed in fury and in disbelief, for though she was forced back onto the burning wheel, and though she felt the strength of Tehlu was greater than chains she had broken, she saw Tehlu was burning in the flames.

“Fool!” she wailed. “You will die here with me. Let me go and live. Let me go and I will trouble you no further.” And the wheel did not ring out, for Encanis was truly frightened.

“No,” said Tehlu. “Your punishment is death. You will serve it.”

“Fool! Madling!” Encanis thrashed to no avail. “You are burning in the flames with me, you will die as I do!”

“To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu. Daughter of myself. Mother of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish.”

So Tehlu held her to the burning wheel, and none of the demon’s threats or screaming moved her the least part of an inch. So it was that Encanis passed from the world, and with her went Tehlu who was Menda. Both of them burned to ash in the pit in Atur. That is why the Tehlin priests wear robes of ashen grey. And that is how we know Tehlu cares for us, and watches us, and keeps us safe from-

Tris broke off her story as Jasper began to howl and thrash against her restraints. I slid softly back into unconsciousness as soon as I no longer had the story to hold my attention.

After that, I began to harbor a suspicion that never entirely left me. Was Tris a Tehlin priest? Her robe was tattered and dirty, but it might have been the proper grey long ago. Parts of her story had been awkward and stumbling, but some were stately and grand, as if she had been reciting them from some half-forgotten memory. Of sermons? Of her readings from the Book of the Path?

I never asked. And though I stopped by her basement frequently in the months that followed, I never heard Tris tell another story again.
