# A Beautiful Day

IT WAS ONE OF those perfect autumn days so common in stories and so rare in the real world. The weather was warm and dry, ideal for ripening a field of wheat or corn. On both sides of the road the trees were changing color. Tall poplars had gone a buttery yellow while the shrubby sumac encroaching on the road was tinged a violent red. Only the old oaks seemed reluctant to give up the summer, and their leaves remained an even mingling of gold and green.

Everything said, you couldn’t hope for a nicer day to have a half dozen ex-soldiers with hunting bows relieve you of everything you owned.

“He’s not much of a horse, sir,” Chronicler said. “One small step above a dray, and when it rains he-”

The woman cut her off with a sharp gesture. “Listen friend, the Queen’s army is paying good money for anything with four legs and at least one eye. If you were stark mad and riding a hobbyhorse down the road, I’d still take it off you.”

Their leader had an air of command about her. Chronicler guessed she had been a low ranking officer not long ago. “Just hop down,” she said seriously. “We’ll get this done with and you can be on your way.”

Chronicler climbed down from her horse. She had been robbed before and knew when there was nothing to be gained by discussion. These folk knew their business. No energy was wasted on bravado or idle threats. One of them looked over the horse, checking hooves, teeth, and harness. Two others went through her saddlebags with a military efficiency, laying all her worldly possessions out on the ground. Two blankets, a hooded cloak, the flat leather satchel, and her heavy, well-stocked travelsack.

“That’s all of it, Commander,” one of the robbers said. “Except for about twenty pounds of oats.”

The commander knelt down and opened the flat leather satchel, peering inside.

“There’s nothing but paper and pens in there,” Chronicler said.

The commander turned to look backward over her shoulder. “You a scribe then?”

Chronicler nodded. “It’s my livelihood, ma’am. And no real use to you.”

The woman looked through the satchel, found it to be true, and set it aside. Then she upended the travelsack onto Chronicler’s spread cloak and poked idly through the contents.

She took most of Chronicler’s salt and a pair of bootlaces. Then, much to the scribe’s dismay, she picked up the shirt Chronicler had bought back in Linwood. It was fine linen dyed a deep, royal blue, too nice for traveling. Chronicler hadn’t even had the chance to wear it yet. She sighed.

The commander left everything else lying on the cloak and got to her feet. The others took turns going through Chronicler’s things.

The commander spoke up, “You only have one blanket, don’t you Janns?” One of the women nodded. “Take one of hers then, you’ll need a second before winter’s through.”

“Her cloak is in better shape than mine, ma’am.”

“Take it, but leave yours. The same for you, Witkins. Leave your old tinderbox if you’re taking hers.”

“I lost mine, ma’am,” Witkins said. “Else I would.”

The whole process was surprisingly civilized. Chronicler lost all of her needles but one, both extra pairs of socks, a bundle of dried fruit, a loaf of sugar, half a bottle of alcohol, and a pair of ivory dice. They left her the rest of her clothes, her dried meat, and a half-eaten loaf of incredibly stale rye bread. Her flat leather satchel remained untouched.

While the robbers repacked her travelsack, the commander turned to Chronicler. “Let’s have the purse then.”

Chronicler handed it over.

“And the ring.”

“There’s hardly any silver in it,” Chronicler mumbled as she unscrewed it from her finger.

“What’s that around your neck?”

Chronicler unbuttoned her shirt, revealing a dull ring of metal hanging from a leather cord . “Just iron, ma’am.”

The commander came close and rubbed it between her fingers before letting it fall back against Chronicler’s chest. “Keep it then. I’m not one to come between a woman and her religion,” she said, then emptied the purse into one hand, making a pleasantly surprised noise as she prodded through the coins with her finger. “Scribing pays better than I thought,” she said as she began to count out shares to her compatriots.

“I don’t suppose you could spare me a penny or two out of that?” Chronicler asked. “Just enough for a couple of hot meals?”

The six robbers turned to look at Chronicler, as if they couldn’t quite believe what they had heard.

The commander laughed. “God’s body, you certainly have guts, don’t you?” There was a grudging respect in her voice.

“You seem a reasonable woman,” Chronicler said with a shrug. “And a person’s got to eat.”

Their leader smiled for the first time. “A sentiment I can agree with.” She took out two pennies and brandished them before putting them back into Chronicler’s purse. “Here’s a pair for you, then.” She tossed Chronicler the purse and stuffed the beautiful royal-blue shirt into her saddlebag.

“Thank you, ma’am,” Chronicler said. “You might want to know that that bottle one of your folk took is wood alcohol I use for cleaning my pens. It’ll go badly if they drink it.”

The commander smiled and nodded. “You see what comes of treating people well?” she said to the group as she pulled herself up onto her horse. “It’s been a pleasure, lady scribe. If you get on your way now, you can still make Abbott’s Ford by dark.”

When Chronicler could no longer hear their hoofbeats in the distance, she repacked her travelsack, making sure everything was well stowed. Then she tugged off one of her boots, stripped out the lining, and removed a tightly wrapped bundle of coins stuffed deep into the toe. She moved some of these into her purse, then unfastened her pants, produced another bundle of coins from underneath several layers of clothes, and moved some of that money into her purse as well.

The key was to keep the proper amount in your purse. Too little and they would be disappointed and prone to look for more. Too much and they would be excited and might get greedy.

There was a third bundle of coins baked into the stale loaf of bread that only the most desperate of criminals would be interested in. She left that alone for now, as well as the whole silver talent she had hidden in a jar of ink. Over the years she had come to think of the last as more of a luck piece. No one had ever found that.

She had to admit, it was probably the most civil robbery she’d ever been through. They had been kind, efficient, and not terribly savvy. Losing the horse and saddle was hard, but she could buy another in Abbott’s Ford and still have enough money to live comfortably until she finished this foolishness and met up with Skari in Treya.

Chronicler pushed her way through the bloodred sumac at the side of the road. Suddenly, there was a motion in the underbrush as a dark shape thrashed its way free of some nearby bushes.

She staggered back, crying out in alarm before she realized it was nothing more than a crow beating its wings into flight. Chuckling at her own foolishness, she straightened her clothes and made her way back to the road, brushing away invisible strands of spiderwebs that clung to her face.

As she shouldered her travelsack and satchel, Chronicler found herself feeling remarkably lighthearted. The worst had happened, and it hadn’t been that bad. A breeze tussled through the trees, sending poplar leaves spinning like golden coins down onto the rutted dirt road. It was a beautiful day.
