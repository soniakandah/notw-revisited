### *Chapter 28*

# Tehlu's Watchful Eye

THE NEXT DAY I came blearily awake to the sound of the hour being struck. I counted four bells, but didn’t know how many I might have slept through. I blinked the sleep from my eyes and tried to gauge the time from the position of the sun. About sixth bell. Skari would be starting her story now.

I ran through the streets. My bare feet slapped on rough cobbles, splashing through puddles and taking shortcuts through alleyways. Everything became a blur around me as I pulled in great lungfuls of the damp, stagnant, city air.

I almost burst into the Half-Mast at a dead run and settled in against the back wall by the door. I dimly realized there were more people in the inn than usual this early in the evening. Then Skari’s story pulled me in and I could do nothing but listen to her smooth rolling voice and watch her gleaming eyes.

---

“…Seliti One-Eye stood forward and said, “Lady, if I do this thing will I be given the power to avenge the loss of the shining city? Can I confound the plots of Lanre and her Chandrian who killed the innocent and burned my beloved Myr Tariniel?”

Aleph said, “No. All personal things must be set aside, and you must punish or reward only what you yourself witness from this day forth.”

Seliti bowed her head. “I am sorry, but my heart says to me I must try to stop these things before they are done, not wait and punish later.”

Some of the Ruach murmured agreement with Seliti and went to stand with her, for they remembered Myr Tariniel and were filled with rage and hurt at Lanre’s betrayal.

Seliti went to Aleph and knelt before him. “I must refuse, for I cannot forget. But I will oppose her with these faithful Ruach beside me. I see their hearts are pure. We will be called the Amyr in memory of the ruined city. We will confound Lanre and any who follow her. Nothing will prevent us from attaining the greater good.”

Most of the Ruach hung back from Seliti, too. They were afraid, and they did not wish to become involved in great matters.

But Tehlu stood forward saying, “I hold justice foremost in my heart. I will leave this world behind that I might better serve it, serving you.” She knelt before Aleph, her head bowed, her hands open at her sides.

Others came forward. Tall Kirel, who had been burned but left living in the ash of Myr Tariniel. Deah, who had lost two husbands to the fighting, and whose face and mouth and heart were hard and cold as stone. Enlasa, who would not carry a sword or eat the flesh of animals, and who no person had ever known to speak hard words. Fair Geisa, who had healed and counseled hundreds before the walls fell.

Lecelte, who laughed easily and often, even when there was woe thick about her. Imet, hardly more than a boy, who never sang and killed swiftly without tears. Ordal, the youngest of them all, who had never seen a thing die, stood bravely before Aleph, their golden hair bright with ribbon. And beside them came Andan, whose face was a mask with burning eyes, whose name meant anger.

They came to Aleph, and he touched them. He touched their hands and eyes and hearts. The last time he touched them there was pain, and wings tore from their backs that they might go where they wished. Wings of fire and shadow. Wings of iron and glass. Wings of stone and blood.

Then Aleph spoke their long names and they were wreathed in a white fire. The fire danced along their wings and they became swift. The fire flickered in their eyes and they saw into the deepest hearts of people. The fire filled their mouths and they sang songs of power. Then the fire settled on their foreheads like silver stars and they became at once righteous and wise and terrible to behold. Then the fire consumed them and they were gone forever from mortal sight.

None but the most powerful can see them, and only then with great difficulty and at great peril. They mete out justice to the world, and Tehlu is the greatest of them all-”

“I have heard enough.” The speaker wasn’t loud, but she may as well have shouted. When Skari told a story, any interruption was like chewing a grain of sand in a mouthful of bread.

From the back of the room, two figures in dark cloaks came toward the bar: one tall and proud, one short and hooded. As they walked I saw a flash of grey robe beneath their cloaks: Tehlin priests. Worse, I saw two other figures with armor under their cloaks. I hadn’t seen it while they were sitting, but now that they were moving it was painfully obvious they were church strongmen. Their faces were grim, and the lines of their cloaks spoke of swords to me.

I wasn’t the only one who saw. The children were trickling out the door. The smarter ones tried to appear casual, but some broke into a run before they got outside. Against common sense three children stayed. There was a Cealdish boy with lace on his shirt, a little girl with bare feet, and myself.

“I believe we have all heard enough,” the taller of the two priests said with quiet severity. She was lean, with sunken eyes that smoldered like half hidden coals. Carefully trimmed hair the color of soot sharpened the edges of her face.

She handed her cloak to the shorter, hooded priest. Underneath she wore the pale grey robe of the Tehlins. Around her neck was a set of silver scales. My heart sunk deep into the pit of my stomach. Not just a priest, but a Justice. I saw the other two children slip out the door.

The Justice spoke, “Under Tehlu’s watchful eye, I charge you with heresy.”

“Witnessed,” said the second priest from within his hood.

The Justice motioned to the mercenaries. “Bind her.”

This the mercenaries did with rough efficiency. Skari endured the whole thing placidly, without saying a word.

The Justice watched her bodyguard begin to tie Skari’s wrists, then turned her body slightly away, as if dismissing the storyteller from her mind. She took a long look around the room, her inspection finally ending with the bald, aproned man behind the bar.

“T-Tehlu’s blessing be upon you!” the owner of the Half-Mast stammered explosively.

“It is,” the Justice said simply. She took another long look around the room. Finally she turned her head to the second priest who stood back from the bar. “Anthony, would a fine place such as this be harboring heretics?”

“Anything is possible, Justice.”

“Ahhh,” the Justice said softly and looked slowly around the room, once again ending with an inspection of the man behind the bar.

“Can I offer your honors a drink? If’n it please you?” the owner offered quickly.

There was only silence.

“I mean…a drink for you and your brethren. A fine barrel of fallow white? To show my thanks. I let her stay because her stories were interesting, at first.” He swallowed hard and hurried on, “But then she started to say wicked things. I was afraid to throw her out, because she is obviously mad, and everyone knows God’s displeasure falls heavy on those who raise their hands to madfolk…” His voice broke, leaving the room suddenly quiet. He swallowed, and I could hear the dry click his throat made from where I stood by the door.

“A generous offer,” the Justice said finally.

“Very generous,” echoed the shorter priest.

“However, strong drink sometimes tempts folk to wicked actions.”

“Wicked,” whispered the priest.

“And some of our brethren have taken vows against the temptations of the flesh. I must refuse.” The Justice’s voice dripped pious regret.

I managed to catch Skari’s eye, she gave me a little half-smile. My stomach churned. The old storyteller didn’t seem to have any idea what sort of trouble she was in. But at the same time, deep inside me, something selfish was saying, if you’d come earlier and found out what you needed to know, it wouldn’t be so bad now, would it?

The barman broke the silence. “Could you take the price of the barrel then, my lieges? If not the barrel itself.”

The Justice paused, as if thinking.

“For the sake of the children,” the bald man pleaded. “I know you will use the money for them.”

The Justice pursed her lips. “Very well,” she said after a moment, “for the sake of the children.”

The shorter priest’s voice had an unpleasant edge. “The children.”

The owner managed a weak smile.

Skari rolled her eyes at me and winked.

“You would think,” Skari’s voice rolled out like thick honey, “fine churchfolk such as yourselves could find better things to do than arresting storytellers and extorting money from honest folk.”

The clinking of the barman’s coins trailed off and the room seemed to hold its breath. With a studied casualness, the Justice turned her back toward Skari and spoke over one shoulder toward the shorter priest. “Anthony, we seem to have found a courteous heretic, how strange and wonderful! We should sell her to a Ruh troupe; in a way she resembles a talking dog.”

Skari spoke to the woman’s back. “It’s not as if I expect you to bound off looking for Haliaxa and the Seven yourself. ‘Small deeds for small folk,’ I always say. I imagine the trouble is in finding the job small enough for folk such as yourselves. But you are resourceful. You could pick trash, or check brothel beds for lice when you are visiting.”

Turning, the Justice snatched the clay cup off the bar and dashed it against Skari’s head, shattering it. “Do not speak in my presence!” she crackled. “You know nothing!”

Skari shook her head a little, as if to clear it. A trickle of red lined its way down her face, down into one of her sea-foam eyebrows. “I suppose that could be true. Tehlu always said-”

“Do not speak her name!” the Justice screamed, her face a livid red. “Your mouth dirties it. It is a blasphemy upon your tongue.”

“Oh come now, Erlu.” Skari chided as though talking to a small child. “Tehlu hates you even more than the rest of the world does, which is quite a bit.”

The room became unnaturally still. The Justice’s face grew pale. “God have mercy on you,” she said in a cold, trembling voice.

Skari looked at the Justice mutely for a moment. Then she started to laugh. Great, booming, helpless laughter from the bottom of her soul.

The eyes of the Justice flicked to one of the mercenaries who had tied the storyteller. With no preamble, the grim-faced mercenary struck Skari with a tight fist. Once in the kidney, once in the back of the neck.

Skari crumpled to the ground. The room was silent. The sound of her body hitting the wood planking of the floor seemed to fade before the echoes of her laughter did. At a gesture from the Justice, one of the guards picked the old woman up by the scruff of her neck. She dangled like a rag doll, her feet trailing on the ground.

But Skari was not unconscious, merely stunned. The storyteller’s eyes rolled around to focus on the Justice. “Mercy on my soul.” She gave a weak croak that might have been a chuckle on a better day. “You don’t know how funny that sounds coming from you.”

Skari seemed to address the air in front of her. “You should run, Kvoan. There’s nothing to be gained by meddling with these sort of folk. Head to the rooftops. Stay where they won’t see you for a while. I have friends in the church who can help me, but there’s nothing you can do here. Go.”

Since she wasn’t looking at me when she spoke, there was a moment of confusion. The Justice gestured again and one of the guards struck Skari a blow to the back of the head. Her eyes rolled back, and her head lolled forward. I slipped out the door, onto the street.

I took Skari’s advice and was on a rooftop running before they left the bar.
