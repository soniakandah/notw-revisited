### *Chapter 08*

# Thieves, Heretics, and Whores

IF THIS STORY IS to be something resembling my book of deeds, we must begin at the beginning. At the heart of who I truly am. To do this, you must remember that before I was anything else, I was one of the Edema Ruh.

Contrary to popular belief, not all traveling performers are of the Ruh. My troupe was not some poor batch of mummers, japing at crossroads for pennies, singing for our suppers. We were court performers, Lady Greyfallow’s performers. Our arrival in most towns was more of an event than the Midwinter Pageantry and Solinade Games rolled together. There were usually at least eight wagons in our troupe and well over two dozen performers: actors and acrobats, musicians and hand magicians, jugglers and jesters: My family.

My mother was a better actor and musician than any you have ever seen. My father had a natural gift for words. They were both beautiful, with dark hair and easy laughter. They were Ruh down to their bones, and that, really, is all that needs to be said.

Save perhaps that my father was a noble before he was a trouper. He told me my mother had lured him away from “a miserable dreary hell” with sweet music and sweeter words. I could only assume he meant Three Crossings, where we went to visit relatives when I was very young. Once.

My parents were never really married, by which I mean they never bothered making their relationship official with any church. I’m not embarrassed by the fact. They considered themselves married and didn’t see much point in announcing it to any government or God. I respect that. In truth, they seemed more content and faithful than many officially married couples I have seen since.

Our patron was Lady Greyfallow, and her name opened many doors that would ordinarily be closed to the Edema Ruh. In return we wore her colors, green and grey, and added to her reputation wherever we went. Once a year we spent two span at her manor, entertaining her and her household.

It was a happy childhood, growing up in the center of an endless fair. My mother would read to me from the great monologues during the long wagon rides between towns. Reciting mostly from memory, her voice would roll down the road for a quarter mile. I remember reading along, coming in on the secondary parts. My mother would encourage me to try particularly good sections myself, and I learned to love the feel of good words.

My father and I would make up songs together. Other times my parents would act out romantic dialogues while I followed along in the books. They seemed like games at the time. Little did I know how cunningly I was being taught.

I was a curious child: quick with questions and eager to learn. With acrobats and actors as my teachers, it is little wonder that I never grew to dread lessons as most children do.

The roads were safer in those days, but cautious folk would still travel with our troupe for safety’s sake. They supplemented my education. I learned an eclectic smattering of Commonwealth law from a traveling barrister too drunk or too pompous to realize she was lecturing an eight-year-old. I learned woodcraft from a hunter named Lail who traveled with us for nearly a whole season.

I learned the sordid inner workings of the royal court in Modeg from a courtesan named Hetera. She always smelled vaguely of cinnamon, and at nine years old I found her fascinating without exactly knowing why. She taught me I should never do anything in private that I didn’t want talked about in public, and cautioned me to not talk in my sleep.

And then there was Abena, my first real teacher. She taught me more than all the others set end to end. If not for her, I would never have become the woman I am today.

I ask that you not hold it against her. She meant well.

“You’ll have to move along,” the mayor said. “Camp outside town and no one will bother you so long as you don’t start any fights or wander off with anything that isn’t yours.” She gave my mother a significant look. “Then be on your merry way tomorrow. No performances. They’re more trouble than they’re worth.”

“We are licensed,” my mother said, pulling out a folded piece of parchment from the inner pocket of her jacket. “Charged to perform, in fact.”

The mayor shook her head and made no motion to look at our writ of patronage. “It makes folk rowdy,” she said firmly. “Last time there was an unholy row during the play. Too much drinking, too much excitement. Folks tore the doors off the public house and smashed up the tables. The hall belongs to the town, you see. The town bears the expense of the repairs.”

By this time our wagons were drawing attention. Trip was doing some juggling. Maria and her husband were putting on an impromptu string-puppet show. I was watching my mother from the back of our wagon.

“We certainly would not want to offend you or your patron,” the mayor said. “However the town can ill afford another evening such as that. As a gesture of goodwill I’m willing to offer you a copper each, say twenty pennies, simply to be on your way and not make any trouble for us here.”

Now you have to understand that twenty pennies might be a good bit of money for some little ragamuffin troupe living hand-to-mouth. But for us it was simply insulting. She should have offered us forty to play for the evening, free use of the public hall, a good meal, and beds at the inn. The last we would graciously decline, as their beds were no doubt lousy and those in our wagons were not.

If my mother was surprised or insulted, she did not show it. “Pack up!” She shouted over one shoulder.

Trip tucked his juggling stones into various pockets without so much as a flourish. There was a disappointed chorus from several dozen townsfolk as the puppets stopped mid-jape and were packed away. The mayor looked relieved, brought out her purse, and pulled out two silver pennies.

“I’ll be sure to tell the Lady of your generosity,” my mother said carefully as the mayor lay the pennies into her hand.

The mayor froze mid-motion. “Lady?”

“Lady Greyfallow.” My mother paused, looking for some spark of recognition on the mayor’s face. “Lady of the eastern marshes, Hudumbran-by-Thiren, and the Wydeconte Hills.” My mother looked around at the horizon. “We are still in the Wydeconte Hills, aren’t we?”

“Well yes,” the mayor said. “But Squire Semelan…”

“Oh, we’re in Semelan’s fief!” my mother exclaimed, looking around as if just now getting her bearings. “Thin gentleman, tidy little beard?” She brushed her chin with her fingers. The mayor nodded numbly. “Charming fellow, lovely singing voice. Met him when we were entertaining the Lady last Midwinter.”

“Of course,” the mayor paused significantly. “Might I see your writ?”

I watched as the mayor read it. It took her a little while, as my mother had not bothered to mention the majority of the Lady’s titles such as the Viscountess of Montrone and Lady of Trelliston. The upshot was this: it was true that the Squire Semelan controlled this little town and all the land around it, but Semelan owed fealty directly to Greyfallow. In more concrete terms, Greyfallow was captain of the ship; Semelan scrubbed the planking and saluted her.

The mayor refolded the parchment and handed it back to my mother. “I see.”

That was all. I remember being stunned when the mayor didn’t apologize or offer my mother more money.

My mother paused as well, then continued, “The city is your jurisdiction, ma’am. But we’ll perform either way. It will either be here or just outside the city limits.”

“Ye can’t use the public house,” the mayor said firmly. “I won’t have it wrecked again.”

“We can play right here,” my mother pointed to the market square. “It will be enough space, and it keeps everyone right here in town.”

The mayor hesitated, though I could hardly believe it. We sometimes chose to play on the green because the local buildings weren’t big enough. Two of our wagons were built to become stages for just that eventuality. But in my whole eleven years of memory I could barely count on both hands the times we’d been forced to play the green. We had never played outside the city limits.

But we were spared that. The mayor nodded at last and gestured my mother closer. I slipped out the back of the wagon and moved close enough to catch the end of what she said, “-God-fearing folk around here. Nothing vulgar or heretical. We had a double handful of trouble with the last troupe that came through here, two fights, folks missing their laundry, and one of Branston’s sons lost a toe.”

I was outraged. I waited for my mother to show the mayor the sharp side of her tongue, to explain the difference between mere traveling performers and Edema Ruh. We didn’t steal. We would never let things get so out of control that a bunch of drunks ruined the hall where we were playing.

But my mother did nothing of the sort, she just nodded and walked back toward our wagon. She gestured and Trip started juggling again. The puppets reemerged from their cases.

As she came around the wagon she saw me standing, half-hidden beside the horses. “I’m guessing you heard the whole thing from the look on your face,” she said with a wry grin. “Let it go, my girl. She gets full marks for honesty if not for grace. She just says out loud what other folk keep in the quiet of their hearts. Why do you think I have everyone stay in pairs when we go about our business in bigger towns?”

I knew it for the truth. Still, it was a hard pill for a young girl to swallow. “Twenty pennies,” I said scathingly. “As if she were offering us charity.”

That was the hardest part of growing up Edema Ruh. We are strangers everywhere. Many folk viewed us as vagabonds and beggars, while others deemed us little more than thieves, heretics, and whores. It’s hard to be wrongfully accused, but it’s worse when the people looking down on you are clods who have never read a book or traveled more than twenty miles from the place they were born.

My mother laughed and roughed my hair. “Just pity her, my girl. Tomorrow we’ll be on our way, but she’ll have to keep her own disagreeable company until the day she dies.”

“She’s an ignorant blatherskate,” I said bitterly.

She lay a firm hand on my shoulder, letting me know I’d said enough. “This is what comes of getting too close to Atur, I suppose. Tomorrow we’ll head south: greener pastures, kinder folk, brawnier men.” She cupped an ear toward the wagon and nudged me with her elbow.

“I can hear everything you say,” my father called sweetly from inside. My mother grinned and winked at me.

“So what play are we going to do?” I asked my mother. “Nothing vulgar, mind you. They’re God-fearing folk in these parts.”

She looked at me. “What would you pick?”

I gave it a long moment’s thought. “I’d play something from the Bright-field Cycle. The Forging of the Path or somesuch.”

My mother made a face. “Not a very good play.”

I shrugged. “They won’t know the difference. Besides, it’s chock full of Tehlu, so no one will complain about it being vulgar.” I looked up at the sky. “I just hope it doesn’t rain on us halfway through.”

My mother looked up at the clouds. “It will. Still, there are worse things than playing in the rain.”

“Like playing in the rain and getting shimmed on the deal?” I asked.

The mayor hurried up to us, moving at a fast walk. There was a thin sheen of sweat on her forehead and she was puffing a little bit, as if she’d been running. “I talked it over with a few members of the council and we decided that it would be quite all right for you to use the public house if you would care to.”

My mother’s body language was perfect . It was perfectly clear she was offended but far too polite to say anything. “I certainly wouldn’t want to put you out…”

“No, no. No bother at all. I insist, in fact.”

“Very well, if you insist.”

The mayor smiled and hurried away.

“Well that’s a little better,” my mother sighed. “No need to tighten our belts yet.”

---

“Halfpenny a head. That’s right. Anyone without a head gets in free. Thank you, miss.”

Trip was working the door, making sure everyone paid to see the play. “Halfpenny a head. Though by the rosy glow in your cheeks I should be charging you for a head and a half. Not that it’s any of my business, mind you.”

Trip had the quickest tongue of anyone in the troupe, which made him the best man for the job of making sure no one tried to fast-talk or bully their way inside. Wearing his green and grey jester’s motley, Trip could say just about anything and get away with it.

“Hello, mum, no charge for the little one, but if she starts to squawk you’d best give her the tit quick or take her outside.” Trip carried on his unending patter. “That’s right, halfpenny. Yes, sir, empty head still pays full price.”

Though it was always fun to watch Trip work, most of my attention was on a wagon that had rolled into the other end of town about a quarter hour ago. The mayor had argued with the old woman driving it, then stormed off. Now I saw the mayor heading back to the wagon accompanied by a tall woman carrying a long cudgel, the constable unless I missed my guess.

My curiosity got the best of me and I made my way toward the wagon, doing my best to stay out of sight. The mayor and the old woman were arguing again by the time I got close enough to hear. The constable stood nearby, looking irritated and anxious.

“…told you. I don’t have a license. I don’t need a license. Does a peddler need a license? Does a tinker need a license?”

“You’re not a tinker,” the mayor said. “Don’t try to pass yourself off as one.”

“I’m not trying to pass myself off as anything,” the old woman snapped. “I’m a tinker and a peddler, and I’m more than both. I’m an arcanist, you great dithering heap of idiot.”

“My point exactly,” the mayor said doggedly. “We’re God-fearing people in these parts. We don’t want any meddling with dark things better left alone. We don’t want the trouble your kind can bring.”

“My kind?” the old woman said. “What do you know about my kind? There probably hasn’t been an arcanist through these parts in fifty years.”

“We like it that way. Just turn around and go back the way you came.”

“Like hell if I’m spending a night in the rain because of your thick head,” the old woman said hotly. “I don’t need your permission to rent a room or do business in the street. Now get away from me or I’ll show you firsthand what sort of trouble my kind can be.”

Fear flashed across the mayor’s face before it was overwhelmed by outrage. She gestured over one shoulder at the constable. “Then you’ll spend the night in jail for vagrancy and threatening behavior. We’ll let you on your way in the morning if you’ve learned to keep a civil tongue in your head.” The constable advanced on the wagon, her cudgel held cautiously at her side.

The old woman stood her ground and raised one hand. A deep, red light welled up from the front corners of her wagon. “That’s far enough,” she said ominously. “Things could get ugly otherwise.”

After a moment’s surprise, I realized the strange light came from a pair of sympathy lamps the old woman had mounted on her wagon. I had seen one before, in Lady Greyfallow’s library. They were brighter than gaslight, steadier than candles or lamps, and lasted nearly forever. They were also terribly expensive. I was willing to bet that no one in this little town had ever heard of them, let alone seen one.

The constable stopped in her tracks when the light began to swell. But when nothing else seemed to happen, she set her jaw and kept walking toward the wagon.

The old woman’s expression grew anxious. “Now hold on a moment,” she said as the red light from the wagon started to fade. “We don’t want…”

“Shut your clepper, you old shit-fire,” the constable said. She snatched at the arcanist’s arm as if she were sticking her hand into an oven. Then, when nothing happened, she smiled and grew more confident. “Don’t think I won’t knock you a good one to keep you from working any more of your devilry.”

“Well done, Tiff,” the mayor said, radiating relief. “Bring her along and we’ll send someone back for the wagon.”

The constable grinned and twisted the old woman’s arm. The arcanist bent at the waist and gasped a short, painful breath.

From where I hid, I saw the arcanist’s face change from anxious, to pained, to angry all in a second. I saw her mouth move.

A furious gust of wind came out of nowhere, as if a storm had suddenly burst with no warning. The wind struck the old woman’s wagon and it tipped onto two wheels before slamming back down onto four. The constable staggered and fell as if she had been struck by the hand of God. Even where I hid nearly thirty feet away the wind was so strong that I was forced to take a step forward, as if I’d been pushed roughly from behind.

“Begone!” the old woman shouted angrily. “Trouble me no longer! I will set fire to your blood and fill you with a fear like ice and iron!” There was something familiar about her words, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Both the mayor and the constable turned tail and ran, their eyes white and wild as startled horses’.

The wind faded as quickly as it had come. The whole sudden burst couldn’t have lasted more than five seconds. As most of the townsfolk were gathered around the public house, I doubted anyone had seen it except for me, the mayor, the constable, and the old woman’s donkeys who stood placidly in their harness, utterly unperturbed.

“Leave this place clean of your foul presence,” the arcanist muttered to herself as she watched them go. “By the power of my name I command it to be so.”

I finally realized why her words seemed so familiar. She was quoting lines from the exorcism scene in Daeonica. Not many folk knew that play.

The old woman turned back to her wagon and began to extemporize. “I’ll turn you into butter on a summer day. I’ll turn you into a poet with the soul of a priest. I’ll fill you with lemon custard and push you out a window.” She spat. “Bitches.”

Her irritation seemed to leave her and she heaved a great, weary sigh. “Well that couldn’t have gone much worse,” the old woman muttered as she rubbed at the shoulder of the arm the constable had twisted. “Do you think they’ll come back with a mob behind them?”

For a second I thought the old woman was talking to me. Then I realized the truth. She was talking to her donkeys.

“I don’t think so either,” she said to them. “But I’ve been wrong before. Let’s stay near the edge of town and have a look at the last of the oats, shall we?”

She clambered up into the back of the wagon and came down with a wide bucket and a nearly empty burlap sack. She upended the sack into the bucket and seemed disheartened by the results. She took out a handful for herself before nudging the bucket toward the donkeys with her foot. “Don’t give me that look,” she said to them. “It’s short rations all around. Besides, you can graze.” She petted one donkey while she ate her handful of rough oats, stopping occasionally to spit out a husk.

It struck me as very sad, this old woman all alone on the road with no one to talk to but her donkeys. It’s hard for us Edema Ruh, but at least we had each other. This woman had no one.

“We’ve wandered too far from civilization, girls. The folk that need me don’t trust me, and the ones that trust me can’t afford me.” The old woman peered into her purse. “We’ve got a penny and a half, so our options are limited. Do we want to be wet tonight or hungry tomorrow? We’re not going to do any business, so it will probably be one or the other.”

I slunk around the edge of the building until I could see what was written on the side of the old woman’s wagon. It read:

ABENA: ARCANIST EXTRAORDINARY.
Scribe. Dowser. Chemist. Dentist.
Rare Goods. All Alements Tended.
Lost Items Found. Anything Mended.
No Horoscopes. No Love Potions. No Malefaction.

Abena noticed me as soon as I stepped out from behind the building where I’d been hiding. “Hello there. Can I help you?”

“You’ve misspelled ‘ailments’,” I pointed out.

She looked surprised. “It’s a joke, actually,” she explained. “I brew a bit.”

“Oh. Ale,” I said, nodding. “I get it.” I brought my hand out of my pocket. “Can you sell me anything for a penny?”

She seemed stuck between amusement and curiosity. “What are you looking for?”

“I’d like some lacillium.” We had performed Farien the Fair a dozen times in the last month, and it had filled my young mind with intrigue and assassination.

“Are you expecting someone to poison you?” she said, somewhat taken aback.

“Not really. But it seems to me that if you wait around until you know you need an antidote, it’s probably too late to pick one up.”

“I suppose I could sell you a penny’s worth,” she said. “That would be about a dose for a person your size. But it’s dangerous stuff in its own right. It only cures certain poisons. You can hurt yourself if you take it at the wrong time.”

“Oh,” I said. “I didn’t know that.” In the play it was touted as an infallible cure-all.

Abena tapped her lips thoughtfully. “Can you answer me a question in the meantime?” I nodded. “Whose troupe is that?”

“In a way it’s mine,” I said. “But in another way, it’s my mother’s because she runs the show and points which way the wagons go. But it’s Lady Greyfallow’s too, because she’s our patron. We’re Lady Greyfallow’s troupe.”

The old woman gave me an amused look. “I’ve heard of you. Good troupe. Good reputation.”

I nodded, not seeing any point in false modesty.

“Do you think your mother might be interested in taking on any help?” she asked. “I don’t claim to be much of an actor, but I’m handy to have around. I could make you face paint and rouge that aren’t all full of lead and mercury and arsenic. I can do lights, too, quick, clean, and bright. Different colors if you want them.”

I didn’t have to think too hard about it; candles were expensive and vulnerable to drafts, torches were dirty and dangerous. And everyone in the troupe learned the dangers of cosmetics at an early age. It was hard to become an old, seasoned trouper when you painted poison on yourself every third day and ended up raving mad by the time you were twenty-five.

“I may be overstepping myself a little,” I said as I held out my hand for her to shake. “But let me be the first to welcome you to the troupe.”

---

If this is to be a full and honest account of my life and deeds, I feel I should mention that my reasons for inviting Abena into our troupe were not entirely altruistic. It’s true that quality cosmetics and clean lights were a welcome addition to our troupe. It’s also true that I’d felt sorry for the old woman alone on the road.

But underneath it all I was moved by my curiosity. I had seen Abena do something I could not explain, something strange and wonderful. Not her trick with the sympathy lamps-I recognized that for what it was: showmanship, a bluff to impress ignorant townsfolk.

What she had done afterward was different. She called the wind and the wind came. It was magic. Real magic. The sort of magic I’d heard about in stories of Taborlin the Great. The sort of magic I hadn’t believed in since I was six. Now I didn’t know what to believe.

So I invited her into our troupe, hoping to find answers to my questions. Though I didn’t know it at the time, I was looking for the name of the wind.
