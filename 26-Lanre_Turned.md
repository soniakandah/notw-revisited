### *Chapter 26*

# Lanre Turned

I HAD BEEN IN Tarbean for years at this point. Three birthdays had slipped by unnoticed and I was just past fifteen. I knew how to survive Waterside. I had become an accomplished beggar and thief. Locks and pockets opened to my touch. I knew which pawn shops bought goods “from aunty” with no questions asked.

I was still ragged and frequently hungry, but I was in no real danger of starving. I had been slowly building my rainy-day money. Even after a hard winter that had frequently forced me to pay for a warm spot to sleep, my hoard was over twenty iron pennies. It was like a dragon’s treasure to me.

I had grown comfortable there. But aside from the desire to add to my rainy-day money I had nothing to live for. Nothing driving me. Nothing to look forward to. My days were spent looking for things to steal and ways to entertain myself.

But that had changed a few days earlier in Tris’ basement. I had heard a young boy speaking in an awed voice about a storyteller who spent all her time in a Dockside bar called the Half-Mast. Apparently, every sixth bell she told a story. Any story you asked for, she knew. What’s more, he said that she had a bet going. If she didn’t know your story, she would give you a whole talent.

I thought about what the boy had said for the rest of the day. I doubted it was true, but I couldn’t help thinking about what I could do with a whole silver talent. I could buy shoes, and maybe a knife, give money to Tris, and still double my rainy-day fund.

Even if the boy was lying about the bet, I was still interested. Entertainment was hard to come by on the streets. Occasionally some ragamuffin troupe would mum a play on a street corner or I’d hear a fiddler in a pub. But most real entertainment cost money, and my hard-won pennies were too precious to squander.

But there was a problem. Dockside wasn’t safe for me.

I should explain. More than a year before, I had seen Pin walking down the street. It had been the first time I’d seen her since my first day in Tarbean when she and her friends had jumped me in that alley and destroyed my mother’s lute.

I followed her carefully for the better part of a day, keeping my distance and staying in the shadows. Eventually she went home to a little box alley Dockside where she had her own version of my secret place. Hers was a nest of broken crates she had cobbled together to keep the weather off.

I perched on the roof all night, waiting until she left the next morning. Then I made my way down to her nest of crates and looked around. It was cozy, filled with the accumulated small possessions of several years. She had a bottle of beer, which I drank. There was also half a cheese that I ate, and a shirt that I stole, as it was slightly less raggedy than my own.

Further searching revealed various odds and ends, a candle, a ball of string, some marbles. Most surprising were several pieces of sailcloth with charcoal drawings of a man’s face. I had to search for nearly ten minutes until I found what I was really looking for. Hidden away behind everything else was a small wooden box that showed signs of much handling. It held a bundle of dried violets tied with a white ribbon, a toy horse that had lost most of its string mane, and a lock of curling blond hair.

It took me several minutes with flint and steel to get the fire going. The violets were good tinder and soon greasy clouds of smoke were billowing high into the air. I stood by and watched as everything Pin loved went up in flames.

But I stayed too long, savoring the moment. Pin and a friend came running down the box alley, drawn by the smoke, and I was trapped. Furious, Pin jumped me. She was taller by six inches and outweighed me by fifty pounds. Worse, she had a piece of broken glass wrapped with twine at one end, making a crude knife.

She stabbed me once in the thigh right above my knee before I smashed her hand into the cobblestones, shattering the knife. After that she still gave me a black eye and several bruised ribs before I managed to kick her squarely in the stomach and get free. As I pelted away she limped after me, shouting that she would kill me for what I’d done.

I believed her. After patching up my leg, I took every bit of rainy-day money I had saved and bought five pints of dreg; a cheap, foul liquor strong enough to blister the inside of your mouth. Then I limped into Dockside and waited for Pin and her friends to spot me.

It didn’t take long, I let her and two of her friends follow me for half a mile, past Seamling Lane and into Tallows. I kept to the main roads, knowing they wouldn’t dare attack me in broad daylight when people were around.

But when I darted into a side alley, they hurried to catch up, suspecting I was trying to make a run for it. However, when they turned the corner no one was there.

Pin thought to look up just as I was pouring the bucket of dreg onto her from the edge of the low roof above. It doused her, splashing across her face and chest. She screamed and clutched at her eyes as she went to her knees. Then I struck the phosphorus match I’d stolen, and dropped it onto her, watching it sputter and flare as it fell.

Full of the pure, hard hatred of a child, I hoped she would burst into a pillar of flame. She didn’t, but did catch fire. She screamed again and staggered around while her friends swatted at her, trying to put her out. I left while they were busy.

It had been over a year ago and I hadn’t seen Pin since. She hadn’t tried to find me, and I had stayed well clear of Dockside, sometimes going miles out of my way rather than pass near it. It was a kind of truce. However, I didn’t doubt that Pin and her friends remembered what I looked like, and were willing to settle the score if they spotted me.

After thinking it over, I decided it was too dangerous. Even the promise of free stories and a chance at a silver talent wasn’t worth stirring things up with Pin again. Besides, what story would I ask for?

---

The question rolled around in my head for the next few days. What story would I ask for? I jostled up against a dockworker and was cuffed away before I could get my hand all the way into her pocket. What story? I begged on the street corner opposite the Tehlin church. What story? I stole three loaves of bread and took two of them down to Tris as a gift. What story?

Then, as I lay on the rooftops in my secret place where three roofs met, it came to me just as I was about to drift off to sleep. Lanre. Of course. I could ask her for the real story of Lanre. The story my mother had been…

My heart stuttered in my chest as I suddenly remembered things I had avoided for years: my mother idly strumming at her lute, my father beside her in the wagon, singing. Reflexively, I began to draw away from the memories, the way you might pull your hand back from a fire.

But I was surprised to find these memories held only a gentle ache, not the deep pain I expected. Instead I found a small, budding excitement at the thought of hearing a story my mother would have sought out. A story she herself might have told.

Still, I knew it to be sheer folly to go running Dockside for the sake of a story. All the hard practicality Tarbean had taught me over the years urged me to stay in my familiar corner of the world, where I was safe…

---

The first thing I saw on entering the Half-Mast was Skari. She was sitting on a tall stool at the bar, an old woman with eyes like rubies and the body of a driftwood scarecrow. She was thin and weathered with thick white hair curling in sharp ringlets around her head. The whiteness of it stood out from her dark skin, making her seem splashed with wave foam.

At her feet were a group of twenty children, a few my age, most younger. They were a strange mix to see, ranging from grubby, shoeless urchins like myself, to reasonably well-dressed, well-scrubbed children who probably had parents and homes.

None of them looked familiar to me, but I never knew who might be a friend of Pin’s. I found a place near the door with my back to the wall and sank down onto my haunches.

Skari cleared her throat once or twice in a way that made me thirsty. Then, with ritual significance, she looked mournfully into the clay mug that sat in front of her and carefully turned it upside down on the bar.

The children surged forward, pressing coins onto the bar. I did a quick count: two iron halfpennies, nine shims, and a drab. Altogether, just a little over three iron pennies in Commonwealth coin. Maybe she was no longer offering the silver talent bet. More likely the rumor I’d heard was wrong.

The old woman nodded almost imperceptibly to the bartender. “Fallows Red.” Her voice was slow and rough, almost hypnotic. The bald man behind the bar gathered up the coins and deftly poured wine into Skari’s wide clay cup.

“So, what would everyone like to hear about today?” Skari rumbled. Her voice rolling out like a distant river.

There was a moment of silence that again struck me as ritualistic, almost reverent. Then a babble burst forth from all the children at once.

“I want a faerie story!”

“…Oren and the fight at Mnat’s…”

“Yes, Oren Velciter! The one with Baron…”

“Lartam…”

“Myr Tariniel!”

“Illien and the Bear!”

“Lanre,” I said, almost without meaning to.

The room went still again as Skari took a drink. The children watched her with a familiar intensity I couldn’t quite identify.

Skari sat calmly in the middle of the quiet. “Did I,” her voice rolled out slowly, like dark honey, “hear someone say Lanre?” She looked directly at me, her brown eyes clear and sharp.

I nodded, not knowing what to expect.

“I want to hear about the dry lands over the Stormwal,” one of the younger girls complained. “About the sand snakes that come out of the ground like sharks. And the dry folk who hide under the dunes and drink your blood instead of water. And-” She was cuffed quickly into silence from a dozen different directions by the children surrounding her.

Silence fell sharply as Skari took another drink. Watching the children as they watched Skari, I realized what they reminded me of: a person anxiously watching a clock. I guessed that when the old woman’s drink was gone, the story she told would be over as well.

Skari took another drink, no more than a sip this time, then set her cup down and pivoted on her stool to face us. “Who would like to hear the story of a woman who lost her eye and gained a better sight?”

Something about the tone of her voice or the reaction of the other children told me this was a purely rhetorical question. “So, Lanre and the Creation War. An old, old story.” Her eyes swept over the children. “Sit and listen for I will speak of the shining city as it once was, years and miles away…”

---

Once, years and miles away, there was Myr Tariniel. The shining city. It sat among the tall mountains of the world like a gem on the crown of a queen.

Imagine a city as large as Tarbean, but on every corner of every street there was a bright fountain, or a green tree growing, or a statue so beautiful it would make a proud person cry to look at it. The buildings were tall and graceful, carved from the mountain itself, carved of a bright white stone that held the sun’s light long after evening fell.

Seliti was lady over Myr Tariniel. Just by looking at a thing, Seliti could see its hidden name and understand it. In those days there were many who could do such things, but Seliti was the most powerful namer of anyone alive in that age.

Seliti was well loved by the people she protected. Her judgments were strict and fair, and none could sway her through falsehood or dissembling. Such was the power of her sight that she could read the hearts of people like heavy-lettered books.

Now in those days there was a terrible war being fought across a vast empire. The war was called the Creation War, and the empire was called Ergen. And despite the fact that the world has never seen an empire as grand or a war so terrible, both of them only live in stories now. Even history books that mentioned them as doubtful rumor have long since crumbled into dust.

The war had lasted so long that folk could hardly remember a time when the sky wasn’t dark with the smoke of burning towns. Once there had been hundreds of proud cities scattered through the empire. Now there were merely ruins littered with the bodies of the dead. Famine and plague were everywhere, and in some places there was such despair that mothers and fathers could no longer muster enough hope to give their children names. But eight cities remained. They were Belen, Antus, Vaeret, Tinusa, Emlen, and the twin cities of Murilla and Murella. Last was Myr Tariniel, greatest of them all and the only one unscarred by the long centuries of war. It was protected by the mountains and brave soldiers. But the true cause of Myr Tariniel’s peace was Seliti. Using the power of her sight she kept watch over the mountain passes leading to her beloved city. Her rooms were in the city’s highest towers so she could see any attack long before it came to be a threat.

The other seven cities, lacking Seliti’s power, found their safety elsewhere. They put their trust in thick walls, in stone and steel. They put their trust in strength of arm, in valor and bravery and blood. And so they put their trust in Lanre.

Lanre had fought since she could lift a sword, and she was unequal in skill. She married a woman named Lyra, and her love for her was a passion fiercer than fury.

Lyra was terrible and wise, and held a power just as great as Lanre. For while Lanre had the strength of her arm and the command of loyal soilders, Lyra knew the names of things, and the power of her voice could kill a person or still a thunderstorm.

As the years passed, Lanre and Lyra fought side by side. They defended Belen from a surprise attack, saving the city from a foe that should have overwhelmed them. They gathered armies and made the cities recognize the need for allegiance. Over the long years they pressed the empire’s enemies back. People who had grown numb with despair began to feel warm hope kindling inside. They hoped for peace, and they hung those flickering hopes on Lanre.

Then came the Blac of Drossen Tor. Blac meant ‘battle’ in the language of the time, and at Drossen Tor there was the largest and most terrible battle of this large and terrible war. They fought unceasing for three days in the light of the sun, and for three nights unceasing by the light of the moon. Neither side could defeat the other, and both were unwilling to retreat.

Of the battle itself I have only one thing to say. More people died at Drossen Tor than there are living in the world today.

Lanre was always where the fight was thickest, where she was needed most. Her sword never left her hand or rested in its sheath. At the very end of things, covered in blood amid a field of corpses, Lanre stood alone against a terrible foe. It was a great beast with scales of black iron, whose breath was a darkness that smothered people. Lanre fought the beast and killed it. Lanre brought victory to her side, but she bought it with her life.

After the battle was finished and the enemy was set beyond the doors of stone, survivors found Lanre’s body, cold and lifeless near the beast she had slain. Word of Lanre’s death spread quickly, covering the field like a blanket of despair. They had won the battle and turned the tide of the war, but each of them felt cold inside. The small flame of hope that each of them cherished began to flicker and fade. Their hopes had hung on Lanre, and Lanre was dead.

In the midst of silence Lyra stood by Lanre’s body and spoke her name. Her voice was a commandment. Her voice was steel and stone. Her voice told Lanre to live again. But Lanre lay motionless and dead.

In the midst of fear Lyra knelt by Lanre’s body and breathed her name. Her voice was beckoning. Her voice was love and longing. Her voice called Lanre to live again. But Lanre lay cold and dead.

In the midst of despair Lyra fell across Lanre’s body and wept her name. Her voice was a whisper. Her voice was echo and emptiness. Her voice begged Lanre to live again. But Lanre lay breathless and dead.

Lanre was dead. Lyra wept brokenly and touched her face with trembling hands. All around folk turned their heads, because the bloody field was less horrible to look upon than Lyra’s grief.

But Lanre heard Lyra calling. Lanre turned at the sound of her voice and came to her. From beyond the doors of death Lanre returned. She spoke her name and took Lyra in her arms to comfort her. She opened her eyes and did her best to wipe away Lyra’s tears with shaking hands. And then she drew a deep and living breath.

The survivors of the battle saw Lanre move and they marveled. The flickering hope for peace each of them had nurtured for so long flared like hot fire inside them.

“Lanre and Lyra!” they shouted, their voices like thunder. “Their love is stronger than death! Our lady’s voice has called her back! Together they have beaten death! Together, how can we help but be victorious?”

So the war continued, but with Lanre and Lyra fighting side by side the future seemed less grim. Soon everyone knew the story of how Lanre had died, and how her love and Lyra’s power had drawn her back. For the first time in living memory people could speak openly of peace without being seen as foolish or mad.

Years passed. The empire’s enemies grew thin and desperate and even the most cynical of folk could see the end of the war was drawing swiftly near.

Then rumors began to spread: Lyra was ill. Lyra had been kidnapped. Lyra had died. Lanre had fled the empire. Lanre had gone mad. Some even said Lanre had killed herself and gone searching for her wife in the land of the dead. There were stories aplenty, but no one knew the truth of things.

In the midst of these rumors, Lanre arrived in Myr Tariniel. She came alone, wearing her silver sword and haubergeon of black iron scales. Her armor fit her closely as a second skin of shadow. She had wrought it from the carcass of the beast she had killed at Drossen Tor.

Lanre asked Seliti to walk with her outside the city. Seliti agreed, hoping to learn the truth of Lanre’s trouble and offer her what comfort a friend can give. They often kept each other’s council, for they were both ladies among their people.

Seliti had heard the rumors, and she was worried. She feared for Lyra’s health, but more she feared for Lanre. Seliti was wise. She understood how grief can twist a heart, how passions drive good folk to folly.

Together they walked the mountain paths. Lanre leading the way, they came to a high place in the mountains where they could look out over the land. The proud towers of Myr Tariniel shone brightly in the last light of the setting sun.

After a long time Seliti said, “I have heard terrible rumors concerning your wife.”

Lanre said nothing, and from her silence Seliti knew that Lyra was dead.

After another long pause Seliti tried again. “Though I do not know the whole of the matter, Myr Tariniel is here for you, and I will lend whatever aid a friend can give.”

“You have given me enough, old friend.” Lanre turned and placed her hand on Seliti’s shoulder. “Silanxi, I bind you. By the name of stone, be still as stone. Aeruh, I command the air. Lay leaden on your tongue. Seliti, I name you. May all your powers fail you but your sight.”

Seliti knew that in all the world there were only three people who could match her skill in names: Aleph, Iax, and Lyra. Lanre had no gift for names-her power lay in the strength of her arm. For her to attempt to bind Seliti by her name would be as fruitless as a child attacking a soldier with a willow stick.

Nevertheless, Lanre’s power lay on her like a great weight, like a vise of iron, and Seliti found herself unable to move or speak. She stood, still as stone and could do nothing but marvel: how had Lanre come by such power?

In confusion and despair, Seliti watched night settle in the mountains. With horror she saw that some of the encroaching blackness was, in fact, a great army moving upon Myr Tariniel. Worse still, no warning bells were ringing. Seliti could only stand and watch as the army crept closer in secret.

Myr Tariniel was burned and butchered, the less that is said of it the better. The white walls were charred black and the fountains ran with blood. For a night and a day Seliti stood helpless beside Lanre and could do nothing more than watch and listen to the screams of the dying, the ring of iron, the crack of breaking stone.

When the next day dawned on the blackened towers of the city, Seliti found she could move. She turned to Lanre and this time her sight did not fail her. She saw in Lanre a great darkness and a troubled spirit. But Seliti still felt the fetters of enchantment binding her. Fury and puzzlement warred within her, and she spoke. “Lanre, what have you done?”

Lanre continued to look out over the ruins of Myr Tariniel. Her shoulders stooped as though she bore a great weight. There was a weariness in her voice when she spoke. “Was I accounted a good person, Seliti?”

“You were counted among the best of us. We considered you beyond reproach.”

“Yet I did this.”

Seliti could not bring herself to look upon her ruined city. “Yet you did this,” she agreed. “Why?”

Lanre paused. “My wife is dead. Deceit and treachery brought me to it, but her death is on my hands.” She swallowed and turned to look out over the land.

Seliti followed her eyes. From the vantage high in the mountains she saw plumes of dark smoke rising from the land below. Seliti knew with certainty and horror that Myr Tariniel was not the only city that had been destroyed. Lanre’s allies had brought about the ruin of the last bastions of the empire.

Lanre turned. “And I counted among the best.” Lanre’s face was terrible to look upon. Grief and despair had ravaged it. “I, considered wise and good, did all this!” She gestured wildly. “Imagine what unholy things a lesser person must hold within their secret heart.” Lanre faced Myr Tariniel and a sort of peace came over her. “For them, at least, it is over. They are safe. Safe from the thousand evils of the everyday. Safe from the pains of an unjust fate.”

Seliti spoke softly, “Safe from the joy and wonder…”

“There is no joy!” Lanre shouted in an awful voice. Stones shattered at the sound and the sharp edges of echo came back to cut at them. “Any joy that grows here is quickly choked by weeds. I am not some monster who destroys out of a twisted pleasure. I sow salt because the choice is between weeds and nothing.” Seliti saw nothing but emptiness behind her eyes.

Seliti stooped to pick up a jagged shard of mountain glass, pointed at one end.

“Will you kill me with a stone?” Lanre gave a hollow laugh. “I wanted you to understand, to know it was not madness that made me do these things.”

“You are not mad,” Seliti admitted. “I see no madness in you.”

“I hoped, perhaps, that you would join me in what I aim to do.” Lanre spoke with a desperate longing in her voice. “This world is like a friend with a mortal wound. A bitter draught given quickly only eases pain.”

“Destroy the world?” Seliti said softly to herself. “You are not mad, Lanre. What grips you is something worse than madness. I cannot cure you.” She fingered the needle-sharp point of the stone she held.

“Will you kill me to cure me, old friend?” Lanre laughed again, terrible and wild. Then she looked at Seliti with sudden, desperate hope in her hollow eyes. “Can you?” she asked. “Can you kill me, old friend?”

Seliti, her eyes unveiled, looked at her friend. She saw how Lanre, nearly mad with grief, had sought the power to bring Lyra back to life again. Out of love for Lyra, Lanre had sought knowledge where knowledge is better left alone, and gained it at a terrible price.

But even in the fullness of her hard-won power, she could not call Lyra back. Without Lyra, Lanre’s life was nothing but a burden, and the power she had taken up lay like a hot knife in her mind. To escape despair and agony, Lanre had killed herself. Taking the final refuge of all people, attempting to escape beyond the doors of death.

But just as Lyra’s love had drawn her back from past the final door before, so this time Lanre’s power forced her to return from sweet oblivion. Her new-won power burned her back into her body, forcing her to live.

Seliti looked at Lanre and understood all. Before the power of her sight, these things hung like dark tapestries in the air about Lanre’s shaking form.

“I can kill you,” Seliti said, then looked away from Lanre’s suddenly hopeful expression. “For an hour, or a day. But you would return, pulled like iron to a loden-stone. Your name burns with the power in you. I can no more extinguish it than I could throw a stone and strike down the moon.”

Lanre’s shoulders bowed. “I had hoped,” she said simply. “But I knew the truth. I am no longer the Lanre you knew. Mine is a new and terrible name. I am Haliaxa and no door can bar my passing. All is lost to me, no Lyra, no sweet escape of sleep, no blissful forgetfulness, even madness is beyond me. Death itself is an open doorway to my power. There is no escape. I have only the hope of oblivion after everything is gone and the Aleu fall nameless from the sky.” And as she said this Lanre hid her face in her hands, and her body shook with silent, racking sobs.

Seliti looked out on the land below and felt a small spark of hope. Six plumes of smoke rose from the land below. Myr Tariniel was gone, and six cities destroyed. But that meant all was not lost. One city still remained…

In spite of all that had happened, Seliti looked at Lanre with pity, and when she spoke it was with sadness in her voice. “Is there nothing then? No hope?” She lay one hand on Lanre’s arm. “There is sweetness in life. Even after all of this, I will help you look for it. If you will try.”

“No,” said Lanre. She stood to her full height, her face regal behind the lines of grief. “There is nothing sweet. I will sow salt, lest the bitter weeds grow.”

“I am sorry,” Seliti said, and stood upright as well.

Then Seliti spoke in a great voice, “Never before has my sight been clouded. I failed to see the truth inside your heart.”

Seliti drew a deep breath. “By my eye I was deceived, never again…” She raised the stone and drove its needle point into her own eye. Her scream echoed among the rocks as she fell to her knees gasping. “May I never again be so blind.”

A great silence descended, and the fetters of enchantment fell away from Seliti. She cast the stone at Lanre’s feet and said, “By the power of my own blood I bind you. By your own name let you be accursed.”

Seliti spoke the long name that lay in Lanre’s heart, and at the sound of it the sun grew dark and wind tore stones from the mountainside.

Then Seliti spoke, “This is my doom upon you. May your face be always held in shadow, black as the toppled towers of my beloved Myr Tariniel.

“This is my doom upon you. Your own name will be turned against you, that you shall have no peace.

“This is my doom upon you and all who follow you. May it last until the world ends and the Aleu fall nameless from the sky.”

Seliti watched as a darkness gathered about Lanre. Soon nothing could be seen of her charmed features, only a vague impression of nose and mouth and eyes. All the rest was shadow, black and seamless.

Then Seliti stood and said, “You have beaten me once through guile, but never again. Now I see truer than before and my power is upon me. I cannot kill you, but I can send you from this place. Begone! The sight of you is all the fouler, knowing that you once were fair.”

But even as she spoke them, the words were bitter in her mouth. Lanre, her face in shadow darker than a starless night, was blown away like smoke upon the wind.

Then Seliti bowed her head and wept hot tears of blood upon the earth.

---

It wasn’t until Skari stopped speaking that I noticed how lost in the story I had become. She tilted her head back and drained the last of the wine from her wide clay cup. She turned it upside-down and set it on the bar with a dull thump of finality.

There was a small clamor of questions, comments, pleas, and thanks from children who had remained still as stones throughout the story. Skari made a small gesture to the barkeep who set out a mug of beer as the children began to trickle out onto the street.

I waited until the last of them had left before I approached her. She turned those dark ruby-brown eyes on me and I stammered.

“Thank you. I wanted to thank you. My mother would have loved that story. It’s the…” I broke off. “I wanted to give you this.” I brought out an iron halfpenny. “I didn’t know what was going on, so I didn’t pay.” My voice seemed rusty. This was probably more than I had spoken in a month.

She looked closely at me. “Here are the rules,” she said, ticking them off on her gnarled fingers. “One: don’t talk while I’m talking. Two: give a small coin, if you have it to spare.”

She looked at the ha’penny on the bar.

Not wanting to admit how much I needed it, I sought for something else to say. “Do you know many stories?”

She smiled, and the network of lines that crossed her face turned to make themselves part of that smile. “I only know one story. But oftentimes small pieces seem to be stories themselves.” She took a drink. “It’s growing all around us. In the manor houses of the Cealdim and in the workshops of the Cealdar, over the Stormwal in the great sand sea. In the low stone houses of the Adem, full of silent conversation. And sometimes.” She smiled. “Sometimes the story is growing in squalid backstreet bars, Dockside in Tarbean.” Her dark eyes looked deep into me, as if I were a book that she could read.

“There’s no good story that doesn’t touch the truth,” I said, repeating something my mother used to say, mostly to fill the silence. It felt strange talking to someone again, strange but good. “There’s as much truth here as anywhere, I suppose. It’s too bad, the world could do with a little less truth and a little more…” I trailed off, not knowing what I wanted more of. I looked down at my hands and found myself wishing they were cleaner.

She slid the halfpenny toward me. I picked it up and she smiled. Her rough hand lit lightly as a bird on my shoulder. “Every day except Mourning. Sixth bell, more or less.”

I started to leave, then stopped. “Is it true? The story.” I made an inarticulate gesture. “The part you told today?”

“All stories are true,” Skari said. “But this one really happened, if that’s what you mean.” She took another slow drink, then smiled again, her eyes dancing. “More or less. You have to be a bit of a liar to tell a story the right way. Too much truth confuses the facts. Too much honesty makes you sound insincere.”

“My mother used to say the same thing.” As soon as I mentioned her a confusing welter of emotions rose up in me. Only when I saw Skari’s eyes following me did I realize I was backing nervously toward the exit. I stopped and forced myself to turn and walk out the door. “I’ll be here, if I can.”

I heard the smile in her voice behind me. “I know.”
