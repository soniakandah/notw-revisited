# Notes

IT WAS WELL PAST midnight by the time Kote made it back to Newarre with Chronicler's limp body slung across her lacerated shoulders. The town's houses and shops were dark and silent, but the Waystone Inn was full of light.

Bassa stood in the doorway, practically dancing with irritation. When she spotted the approaching figure she rushed down the street, waving a piece of paper angrily. "A note? You sneak out and leave me a note?" She hissed angrily. "What am I, some simple bar-hand?"

Kote turned around and shrugged Chronicler's limp body into Bassa's arms. "I knew you would just argue with me, Bassa."

Bassa held Chronicler easily in front of her. "It wasn't even a good note. 'If you are reading this I am probably dead.' What sort of a note is that?"

"You weren't supposed to find it till morning," Kote said tiredly as they began to walk down the street to the inn.

Bassa looked down at the woman she was carrying, as if noticing her for the first time. "Who is this?" She shook her a little, eyeing her curiously before slinging her easily over one shoulder like a burlap sack.

"Some unlucky sod who happened to be on the road at the wrong time," Kote said dismissively. "Don't shake her too much. Her head might be on a little loose."

"What the hell did you sneak off for, anyway?" Bassa demanded as they entered the inn. "If you're going to leave a note it should at least tell me what-" Bassa's eyes widened as she saw Kote in the light of the inn, pale and streaked with blood and dirt.

"You can go ahead and worry if you want," Kote said dryly. "It's every bit as bad as it looks."

"You went out hunting for them, didn't you?" Bassa hissed, then her eyes widened. "No. You kept a piece of the one Cathrine killed. I can't believe you. You lied to me. To me!"

Kote sighed as she trudged up the stairs. "Are you upset by the lie, or the fact that you didn't catch me at it?" she asked as she began to climb.

Bassa spluttered. "I'm upset that you thought you couldn't trust me."

They let their conversation lapse as they opened one of the many empty rooms on the second floor, tended to Chronicler, and tucked her snugly into bed. Kote left the woman's satchel and travelsack on the floor nearby.

Closing the door to the room behind her, Kote said, "I trust you Bassa, but I wanted you safe. I knew I could handle it."

"I could have helped, Reshi." Bassa's tone was injured. "You know I would have."

"You can still help, Bassa," Kote said as she made her way to her room and sat heavily on the edge of her narrow bed. "I need some stitching done." She began to unbutton her shirt. "I could do it myself. But the tops of my shoulders and my back are hard to reach."

"Nonsense, Reshi. I'll do it."

Kote made a gesture to the door. "My supplies are down in the basement."

Bassa sniffed disdainfully. "I will use my own needles, thank you very much. Good honest bone. None of your nasty jagged iron things, stabbing you like little slivers of hate." She shivered . "Stream and stone, it's frightening how primitive you people are." Bassa bustled out of the room, leaving the door open behind her.

Kote slowly removed her shirt, grimacing and sucking her breath through her teeth as the dried blood stuck and tugged against the wounds. Her face went stoic again when Bassa came back into the room with a basin of water and began to clean her off.

As the dried blood was washed away a wild scoring of long, straight cuts became clear. They gaped redly against the innkeeper's bronze skin, as if she had been slashed with a barber's razor or a piece of broken glass. There were perhaps a dozen cuts in all, most of them on the tops of her shoulders, a few across her back and along her arms. One started on the top of her head and ran down her scalp to behind her ear.

"I thought you weren't supposed to bleed, Reshi," Bassa said. "Bloodless and all that."

"Don't believe everything you hear in stories, Bassa. They lie to you."

"Well you aren't nearly as bad off as I thought," Bassa said, wiping her hands clean. "Though by all rights you should have lost a piece of your ear. Were they wounded like the one that attacked Cathrine?"

"Not that I could see," Kote said.

"How many were there?"

"Five."

"Five?" Bassa said, aghast. "How many did the other woman kill?"

"She distracted one of them for a while," Kote said generously.

"Anpauen, Reshi," Bassa said, shaking her head as she threaded a bone needle with something thinner and finer than gut. "You should be dead. You should be dead twice."

Kote shrugged. "It's not the first time I should be dead, Bassa. I'm a fair hand at avoiding it."

Bassa bent to her work. "This will sting a bit," she said, her hands strangely gentle. "Honestly Reshi, I can't see how you've managed to stay alive this long."

Kote shrugged again and closed her eyes. "Neither do I, Bassa," she said. Her voice was tired and grey.

---

Hours later, the door to Kote's room cracked open and Bassa peered inside. Hearing nothing but slow, measured breathing, the young woman walked softly to stand beside the bed and bent over her sleeping master. Bassa eyed the color of her cheeks, smelled her breath, and lightly touched her forehead, her wrist, and the hollow of her throat above her heart.

Then Bassa drew a chair alongside the bed and sat, watching her master, listening to her breathe. After a moment she reached out and brushed the unruly red hair back from her face, like a mother would with a sleeping child. Then she began to sing softly, the tune lilting and strange, almost a lullaby:

"How odd to watch a mortal kindle

Then to dwindle day by day.

Knowing their bright souls are tinder

And the wind will have its way.

Would I could my own fire lend.

What does your flickering portend?"

Bassa's voice faded until at last she sat motionless, watching the rise and fall of her master's silent breathing through the long hours of morning's early dark.
