### *Chapter 35* 

# The Parting of Ways

THE WEATHER HELD FAIR, which meant that the wagons rolled into Imre just as the sun was setting. My mood was sullen and hurt. Deren had shared a wagon with Josephine the whole of the day, and I, being foolish and proud, had kept my distance.

A whirl of activity sprang up as soon as the wagons rolled to a stop. Roe began to argue with a clean-shaven man in a velvet hat before they brought their wagon to a full stop. After the initial bout of bargaining, a dozen people began unloading bolts of cloth, barrels of molasses, and burlap sacks of coffee. Reta cast a stern eye over the lot of them. Josephine scuttled around, trying to keep her luggage from being damaged or stolen.

My own luggage was easier to manage, as I only had my travelsack. I retrieved it from between some bolts of cloth and moved away from the wagons. I slung it over one shoulder and looked around for Deren.

I found Reta instead. “You were a great help on the road,” she said. Her Aturan was much better than Roe’s, with hardly any trace of a Siaru accent at all. “It is nice to have someone along who can unhitch a horse without being led by the hand.” She held out a coin to me.

I took it without thinking. It was a reflex action from my years as a beggar. Like the reverse of jerking your hand back from a fire. Only after the coin was in my hand did I take a closer look at it. It was a whole copper jot, fully half of what I had paid to travel with them to Imre. When I looked back up, Reta was heading back toward the wagons.

Not sure what to think, I wandered over to where Brandy sat on the edge of a horse trough. She shaded her eyes against the evening sun with one hand as she looked up at me. “On your way then? I almost thought you might stick with us for a while.”

I shook my head. “Reta just gave me a jot.”

She nodded. “I’m not terribly surprised. Most folks are nothing but dead weight.” She shrugged. “And she appreciated your playing. Have you ever thought of trying out as a minstrel? They say Imre’s a good place for it.”

I steered the conversation back to Reta. “I don’t want Roe to be angry with her. They seem to take their money pretty seriously.”

Brandy waved her hands back and forth, shrugging away my concern. “Roe knows. They might have even sent her over to do it. But Cealdish folk can be strange about that sort of thing. They don’t even buy things if they can help it. Roe is a traditionalist, Reta is the practical one. Didn’t you notice that it was Reta who bargained for our rooms and food at the inn a few nights ago?”

I did remember, now that she mentioned it. I looked down at the copper jot in my hand, wondering about all the cultural implications it presented. 

“Brandy!” Roe’s voice came from behind the wagons.

She sighed as she stood up. “Duty calls,” she said. “See you around.”

I tucked the jot into my pocket and thought more about what Brandy had said. The truth was, my troupe had never gone so far north as to make it into the Shald. It was unnerving to realize I wasn’t as world-wise as I’d thought.

I slung my travelsack over my shoulder and looked around one last time, thinking that perhaps it would be best if I left without any troublesome good-byes. Deren was nowhere to be seen. That settled it then. I turned to leave…

…and found him standing behind me. He smiled a little awkwardly with his hands clasped behind his back. He was lovely as a springtime breeze, and I wondered if he knew it. I was suddenly short of breath, and I forgot myself, my irritation at Josephine, my lonely last days with the group.

“You’re still going?” He asked.

I nodded.

“You could come to Anilin with us,” he suggested. “They say the streets are paved with gold there. You could teach Josephine to play that lute she carries around.” He smiled. “I’ve asked her, and she’s said she wouldn’t mind.”

I considered it. For half a heartbeat I almost threw my whole plan aside just to stay with him a little longer. But the moment passed and I shook my head.

“Don’t fret,” he chided me with a smile. “I’ll be in Anilin for a while, if things don’t work out for you here. Perhaps you could drop me a visit?” He trailed off hopefully.

I didn’t know what I could do if things didn’t work out for me here. I was hanging all my hopes on the University. Besides, Anilin was hundreds of miles away. I barely owned the clothes on my back. How would I find him?

Deren must have seen my thoughts reflected on my face. He smiled playfully. “I guess I’ll just have to come looking for you, then.”

We Ruh are travelers. Our lives are composed of meetings and partings, with brief, bright acquaintances in-between. Because of this I knew the truth. I felt it, heavy and certain in the pit of my stomach: I would never see him again.

Before I could say anything he looked nervously behind him. “I had better go. Watch for me.” He flashed his impish smile again before turning to walk away.

“I will,” I called after him. “I’ll see you where the roads meet.”

He glanced back and hesitated for a moment, then waved and ran off into the early evening twilight.
