# Of Beginnings and the Names of Things

SUNLIGHT POURED INTO THE Waystone. It was a cool, fresh light, fitted for beginnings. It brushed past the miller as she set her water-wheel turning for the day. It lit the forge the smith was rekindling after four days of cold metal work. It touched draft horses hitched to wagons and sickle blades glittering sharp and ready at the beginning of an autumn day.

Inside the Waystone, the light fell across Chronicler’s face and touched a beginning there, a blank page waiting the first words of a story. The light flowed across the bar, scattered a thousand tiny rainbow beginnings from the colored bottles, and climbed the wall toward the sword, as if searching for one final beginning.

But when the light touched the sword there were no beginnings to be seen. In fact, the light the sword reflected was dull, burnished, and ages old. Looking at it, Chronicler remembered that though it was the beginning of a day, it was also late autumn and growing colder. The sword shone with the knowledge that dawn was a small beginning compared to the ending of a season; the ending of a year.

Chronicler pulled her eyes away from the sword, aware that Kvoan had said something, but not knowing what. “I beg your pardon?”

“How do people normally go about relating their stories?” Kvoan asked.

Chronicler shrugged. “Most simply tell me what they remember. Later, I record events in the proper order, remove the unnecessary pieces, clarify, simplify, that sort of thing.”

Kvoan frowned. “I don’t think that will do.”

Chronicler gave her a shy smile. “Storytellers are always different. They prefer their stories be left alone. But they also prefer an attentive audience. I usually listen and record later. I have a nearly perfect memory.”

“Nearly perfect doesn’t quite suit me.” Kvoan pressed a finger against her lips. “How fast can you write?”

Chronicler gave a knowing smile. “Faster than any can talk.”

Kvoan raised an eyebrow. “I’d like to see that.”

Chronicler opened her satchel. She brought out a stack of fine, white paper and a bottle of ink. After arranging them carefully, she dipped a pen and looked expectantly at Kvoan.

Kvoan sat forward in her chair and spoke quickly, “I am. We are. She is. He was. They will be.” Chronicler’s pen danced and scratched down the page as Kvoan watched it. “I, Chronicler, do hereby avow that I can neither read nor write. Supine. Irreverent. Jackdaw. Quartz. Lacquer. Eggoliant. Lhin ta Lu soren hea. ‘There was a young widower from Faeton, whose morals were hard as a rock. He went to confession, for his true obsession-’” Kvoan leaned farther forward to watch as Chronicler wrote. “Interesting-oh, you may stop.”

Chronicler smiled again and wiped her pen on a piece of cloth. The page in front of her held a single line of incomprehensible symbols. “Some sort of cipher?” Kvoan wondered aloud. “Very neatly done, too. I’ll bet you don’t spoil many pages.” She turned the sheet to look at the writing more carefully.

“I never spoil pages,” Chronicler said haughtily.

Kvoan nodded without looking up.

“What does ‘eggoliant’ mean?” Chronicler asked.

“Hmmm? Oh, nothing. I made it up. I wanted to see if an unfamiliar word would slow you down.” She stretched, and pulled her chair closer to Chronicler’s. “As soon as you show me how to read this, we can begin.”

Chronicler looked doubtful. “It’s a very complex-” Seeing Kvoan frown, she sighed. “I’ll try.”

Chronicler drew a deep breath and began to write a line of symbols as she spoke. “There are around fifty different sounds we use to speak. I’ve given each of them a symbol consisting of one or two pen strokes. It’s all sound. I could conceivably transcribe a language I don’t even understand.” She pointed. “These are different vowel sounds.”

“All vertical lines?” Kvoan said, looking intently at the page.

“Yes,” The Chronicler gestured to another segment of the writing. “And the consonants are horizontal, combined like this.” She copied a segment again for Kvoan to see, sounding out the parts of the word as she wrote. 

Taking the pen, Kvoan made a few marks of her own on the page. “Clever. You’d never need more than two or three for a word.”

Chronicler watched Kvoan quietly. Kvoan didn’t notice, her attention on the paper. “If this is ‘am’ then these must be the ah sounds,” she motioned to a group of characters Chronicler had penned. “Ah, ay, aeh, auh. That would make these the ohs.” Kvoan nodded to herself and pressed the pen back into Chronicler’s hand. “Show me the consonants.”

Chronicler penned them down nimbly, reciting the sounds as she wrote. After a moment, Kvoan took the pen and copied the list herself, asking the Chronicler to correct her if she made a mistake.

Chronicler watched and listened as Kvoan completed the list. From beginning to end the whole process took about fifteen minutes. She made no mistakes.

“Wonderfully efficient system,” Kvoan said appreciatively. “Very logical. Did you design it yourself?”

Chronicler took a long moment before she spoke, staring at the rows of characters on the page in front of Kvoan. Finally, disregarding Kvoan’s question, Chronicler asked, “Did you really learn Tema in a day?”

Kvoan gave a faint smile and looked down at the table. “That’s an old story. I’d almost forgotten. It took a day and a half, actually. A day and a half with no sleep. Why do you ask?”

“I heard about it at the University. I never really believed it.” She looked down at the page of her cipher in Kvoan’s neat handwriting . “All of it?”

Kvoan looked puzzled. “What?”

“Did you learn the whole language?”

“No. Of course not,” Kvoan laughed. “Only a portion of it. Whatever I needed to know at the time. But come now, we’re getting ahead of ourselves, if we’re starting then we should start at the beginning.”

Chronicler shook her head as if to clear it, set out a new sheet of paper, and nodded.

Kvoan held up a hand to keep Chronicler from writing, and spoke, “I’ve never told this story before, and I doubt I’ll ever tell it again.” Kvoan leaned forward in her chair. “Before we begin, you must remember that I am of the Edema Ruh. We were telling stories before Caluptena burned. Before there were books to write in. Before there was music to play. When the first fire kindled, we Ruh were there spinning stories in the circle of its flickering light.”

Kvoan nodded to the scribe. “I know your reputation as a great collector of stories and recorder of events.” Kvoan’s eyes became hard as flint, sharp as broken glass. “That said, do not presume to change a word of what I say. If I seem to wander, if I seem to stray, remember that true stories seldom take the straightest way.”

Chronicler nodded solemnly, trying to imagine the mind that could break apart her cipher in a piece of an hour. A mind that could learn a language in a day.

Kvoan gave a gentle smile and looked around the room as if fixing it in her memory. Chronicler dipped her pen and Kvoan looked down at her folded hands for as long as it takes to draw three deep breaths.

Then she began to speak.

“In some ways, it began when I heard him singing. His voice twinning, mixing with my own. His voice was like a portrait of his soul: wild as a fire, sharp as shattered glass, sweet and clean as clover.”

Kvoan shook her head. “No. It began at the University. I went to learn magic of the sort they talk about in stories. Magic like Taborlin the Great. I wanted to learn the name of the wind. I wanted fire and lightning. I wanted answers to ten thousand questions and access to their archives. But what I found at the University was much different than a story, and I was much dismayed.

“But I expect the true beginning lies in what led me to the University. Unexpected fires at twilight. A figure with eyes like ice at the bottom of a well. The smell of blood and burning hair. The Chandrian.” She nodded to herself. “Yes. I suppose that is where it all begins. This is, in many ways, a story about the Chandrian.”

Kvoan shook her head, as if to free herself from some dark thought. “But I suppose I must go even further back than that. If this is to be something resembling my book of deeds, I can spare the time. It will be worth it if I am remembered, if not flatteringly, then at least with some small amount of accuracy.

“But what would my mother say if she heard me telling a story this way? ‘Begin at the beginning.’ Very well, if we are to have a telling, let’s make it a proper one.”

Kvoan sat forward in her chair.

“In the beginning, as far as I know, the world was spun out of the nameless void by Aleph, who gave everything a name. Or, depending on the version of the tale, found the names all things already possessed.”

Chronicler let slip a small laugh, though she did not look up from her page or pause in her writing.

Kvoan continued, smiling herself. “I see you laugh. Very well, for simplicity’s sake, let us assume that beginning is known. In doing this, let us pass over innumerable boring stories: the rise and fall of empires, sagas of heroism, ballads of tragic love. Let us hurry forward to the only tale of any real importance.” Her smile broadened. “Mine.”

My name is Kvoan, given to me by my mother. Names are important as they tell you a great deal about a person. I’ve had more names than anyone has a right to.

The Adem called me Maedre. Which, depending on how it’s spoken, can mean “The Flame,” “The Thunder,” or “The Broken Tree.”

“The Flame” is obvious if you’ve ever seen me. I have red hair, bright. If I had been born a couple hundred years ago I would probably have been burned as a demon. I keep it short but it’s unruly. When left to its own devices, it sticks up and makes me look as if I have been set afire.

“The Thunder” I attribute to a strong voice and a great deal of stage training at an early age.

I’ve never thought of “The Broken Tree” as very significant. Although in retrospect I suppose it could be considered at least partially prophetic.

My first mentor called me E’lir because I was clever and I knew it. My first real lover called me Dulata because she liked the sound of it. I have been called Shadicar, Lightfinger, and Six-String. I have been called Kvoan the Bloodless, Kvoan the Arcane, and Kvoan Queenkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them.

But I was brought up as Kvoan. My mother once told me it meant “to know.”

I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.

I have stolen valuables back from sleeping royalty. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent nights in the Fae and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I have tread paths that were cursed, and yet still live today. I have talked to Gods, loved deeply, and written songs that only the finest lute played.

You may have heard of me.
