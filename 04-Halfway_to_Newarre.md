### *Chapter 04*

# Halfway to Newarre

CHRONICLER WALKED. Yesterday she had limped, but today there was no part of her feet that didn’t hurt, so limping did no good. She had searched for horses in Abbott’s Ford and Rannish, offering outrageous prices for even the most broken-down animals. But in small towns like these, people didn’t have horses to spare, especially not with harvest fast approaching.

Despite a hard day’s walking, she was still on the road when night fell, making the rutted dirt road a stumbling ground of half-seen shapes. After two hours of fumbling through the dark, Chronicler saw light flickering through the trees and abandoned any thought of making it to Newarre that night, deciding a farmstead’s hospitality would be welcome enough.

She left the road, blundering through the trees toward the light. But the fire was farther away than she had thought, and larger. It wasn’t lamplight from a house, or even sparks from a campfire. It was a bonfire roaring in the ruins of an old house, little more than two crumbling stone walls. Huddled into the corner those two walls made was a slouched figure. They wore a heavy hooded cloak, bundled up as if it were full winter and not a mild autumn evening.

Chronicler’s hopes rose at the sight of a small cook fire with a pot hanging over it. But as she came close, she caught a foul scent mingling with the woodsmoke. It reeked of burning hair and rotting flowers. Chronicler quickly decided that whatever the person was cooking in the iron pot, she wanted none of it. Still, even a place next to a fire was better than curling up by the side of the road.

Chronicler stepped into the circle of firelight. “I saw your f-” She stopped as the figure sprang quickly to their feet, a sword held with both hands. No, not a sword, a long, dark cudgel of some sort, too regularly shaped to be a piece of firewood.

Chronicler stopped dead in her tracks. “I was just looking for a place to sleep,” she said quickly, her hand unconsciously clutching at the circle of iron that hung around her neck. “I don’t want any trouble. I’ll leave you to your dinner.” She took a step backward.

The figure relaxed, and the cudgel dropped to grate metallically against a stone. “Charred body of God, what are you doing out here at this time of night?”

“I was headed to Newarre and saw your fire.”

“You just followed a strange fire into the woods at night?” The hooded figure shook their head. “You might as well come here.” They motioned Chronicler closer, and the scribe saw they were wearing thick leather gloves. “Tehlu anyway, have you had bad luck your whole life, or have you been saving it all up for tonight?”

“I don’t know who you’re waiting for,” Chronicler said, taking a step backward. “But I’m sure you’d rather do it alone.”

“Shut up and listen,” the figure said sharply. “I don’t know how much time we have.” They looked down and rubbed at their face. “God, I never know how much to tell you people. If you don’t believe me, you’ll think I’m crazy. If you do believe me, you’ll panic and be worse than useless.” Looking back up, they saw Chronicler hadn’t moved. “Get over here, damn you. If you go back out there you’re as good as dead.”

Chronicler glanced over her shoulder into the dark of the forest. “Why? What’s out there?”

The figure gave a short, bitter laugh and shook their head in exasperation. “Honestly?” They ran their hand absentmindedly though their hair, brushing their hood back in the process. In the firelight the Chronicler saw that it was a woman, with hair that was impossibly red, and eyes a shocking, vibrant green. She looked at Chronicler, sizing her up. “Demons,” she said. “Demons in the shape of big, black spiders.”

Chronicler relaxed. “There’s no such thing as demons.” From her tone it was obvious she’d said the same thing many, many times before.

The red-haired woman gave an incredulous laugh. “Well, I guess we can all go home then!” She flashed a manic grin at Chronicler. “Listen, I’m guessing you’re an educated woman. I respect that, and for the most part, you’re right.” Her expression went serious. “But here and now, tonight, you’re wrong. Wrong as wrong can be. You don’t want to be on that side of the fire when you figure that out.”

The flat certainty in the woman’s voice sent a chill down Chronicler’s back. Feeling more than slightly foolish, she stepped delicately around to the other side of the bonfire.

“I don’t suppose you have any weapons?” the woman asked. Chronicler shook her head. “It doesn’t really matter. A sword wouldn’t do you much good.” She handed Chronicler a heavy piece of firewood. “You probably won’t be able to hit one, but it’s worth a try. They’re fast. If one of them gets on you, just fall down. Try to land on it, crush it with your body. Roll on it. If you get hold of one, throw it into the fire.”

She drew the hood back over her head, speaking quickly. “If you have any extra clothes, put them on. If you have a blanket you could wrap-”

She stopped suddenly and looked out across the circle of firelight. “Get your back against the wall,” she said abruptly, bringing her iron cudgel up with both hands.

Chronicler looked past the bonfire. Something dark was moving in the trees.

They came into the light, moving low across the ground: black shapes, many-legged and large as cart wheels . One, quicker than the rest, rushed into the firelight without hesitating, moving with the disturbing, sinuous speed of a scuttling insect.

Before Chronicler could raise her piece of firewood, the thing skirted sideways around the bonfire and sprang at her, quick as a cricket. Chronicler threw up her hands just as the black thing struck her face and chest. Its cold, hard legs scrambled for a hold and she felt bright stripes of pain across the backs of her arm. Staggering away, the scribe felt her heel snag on the rough ground, and she began to topple over backward, arms flailing wildly.

As she fell, Chronicler caught one last glimpse of the circle of firelight. More of the black things were scuttling out of the dark, their feet beating a quick staccato rhythm against roots and rocks and leaves. On the other side of the fire the woman in the heavy cloak held her iron cudgel ready with both hands. She stood perfectly still, perfectly silent, waiting.

Still falling backward with the dark thing on top of her, Chronicler felt a dull, dark explosion as the back of her head struck the stone wall behind her. The world slowed, turned blurry, then black.

Chronicler opened her eyes to a confusing mass of dark shapes and firelight. Her skull throbbed. There were several lines of bright, clear pain crossing the backs of her arms and a dull ache that pulled at her left side every time she drew in a breath.

After a long moment of concentration the world came into a blurry focus. The bundled woman sat nearby. She was no longer wearing her gloves, and her heavy cloak hung off her body in loose tatters, but other than that she seemed unscathed. Her hood was up, hiding her face.

“You’re awake?” the woman asked curiously. “That’s good. You can never be sure with a head wound.” The hood tilted a bit. “Can you talk? Do you know where you are?”

“Yes,” Chronicler said thickly. It seemed to take far too much effort to make a single word.

“Even better. Now, third time pays for all. Do you think you can stand up and lend me a hand? We need to burn and bury the bodies.”

Chronicler moved her head a bit and felt suddenly dizzy and nauseous. “What happened?”

“I might have broken a couple of your ribs,” the woman said. “One of them was all over you. I didn’t have a lot of options.” She shrugged. “I’m sorry, for whatever that’s worth. I’ve already stitched up the cuts on your arms. They should heal up nicely.”

“They’re gone?”

The hood nodded once. “The scrael don’t retreat. They’re like wasps from a hive. They keep attacking until they die.”

A horrified look spread over Chronicler’s face. “There’s a hive of these things?”

“Dear God, no. There were just these five. Still, we have to burn and bury them, just to be sure. I already cut the wood we’ll need: ash and rowan.”

Chronicler gave a laugh that sounded slightly hysterical. “Just like the children’s song:

“Let me tell you what to do.

Dig a pit that’s ten by two.

Ash and elm and rowan too-”

“Yes indeed,” the bundled woman said dryly. “You’d be surprised at the sorts of things hidden away in children’s songs. But while I don’t think we need to dig the entire ten feet down, I wouldn’t refuse a little help…” She trailed off meaningfully.

Chronicler moved one hand to feel the back of her head gingerly, then looked at her fingers, surprised that they weren’t covered in blood. “I think I’m fine,” she said as she cautiously levered herself up onto one elbow and from there into a sitting position. “Is there any-” Her eyes flickered and she went limp, falling bonelessly backward. Her head struck the ground, bounced once, and came to rest tilted slightly to one side.

Kote sat patiently for a few long moments, watching the unconscious woman. When there was no movement other than the chest slowly rising and falling, she came stiffly to her feet and knelt at Chronicler’s side. Kote lifted one eyelid, then the other and grunted at what she saw, not seeming particularly surprised.

“I don’t suppose there’s any chance of you waking up again?” she asked without much hope in her voice. She tapped Chronicler’s pale cheek lightly. “No chance at-” A drop of blood spotted Chronicler’s forehead, followed quickly by another.

Kote straightened up so that she was no longer leaning over the unconscious woman and wiped the blood away as best she could, which wasn’t very well, as her hands were covered in blood themselves. “Sorry,” she said absently.

She gave a deep sigh and pushed back her hood. Her red hair was matted down against her head, and half her face was smeared with drying blood. Slowly she began to peel away the tattered remains of her cloak. Underneath was a leather blacksmith’s apron, wildly scored with cuts. She removed that as well, revealing a plain grey shirt of homespun. Both her shoulders and her left arm were dark and wet with blood.

Kote fingered the buttons of her shirt for a moment, then decided against removing it. Climbing gingerly to her feet, she picked up the spade and slowly, painfully, began to dig.
