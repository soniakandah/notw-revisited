### *Chapter 06*

# The Price of Remembering

IT WAS EARLY EVENING of the next day before Chronicler came down the stairs to the common room of the Waystone Inn. Pale and unsteady, she carried her flat leather satchel under one arm.

Kote sat behind the bar, paging through a book. “Ah, our unintentional guest. How’s the head?”

Chronicler raised a hand to touch the back of her head. “Throbs a bit when I move around too quickly. But it’s still working.”

“Glad to hear it,” Kote said.

“Is this…” Chronicler hesitated, looking around. “Are we in Newarre?”

Kote nodded. “You are, in fact, in the middle of Newarre.” She made a dramatic sweeping gesture with one hand. “Thriving metropolis. Home to dozens.”

Chronicler stared at the red-haired woman behind the bar. She leaned against one of the tables for support. “God’s charred body,” she said breathlessly. “It really is you, isn’t it?”

The innkeeper looked puzzled. “I beg your pardon?”

“I know you’re going to deny it,” Chronicler said. “But what I saw last night…”

The innkeeper held up a hand, quieting her. “Before we discuss the possibility that you’ve addled your wits with that crack to the head, tell me, how is the road to Tinuë?”

“What?” Chronicler asked, irritated. “I wasn’t heading to Tinuë. I was…oh. Well even aside from last night, the road’s been pretty rough. I was robbed off by Abbot’s Ford, and I’ve been on foot ever since. But it was all worth it since you’re actually here.” The scribe glanced at the sword hanging over the bar and drew a deep breath, her expression becoming vaguely anxious. “I’m not here to cause trouble, mind you. I’m not here because of the price on your head.” She gave a weak smile. “Not that I could hope to trouble you-”

“Fine,” the innkeeper interrupted as she pulled out a white linen cloth and began to polish the bar. “Who are you then?”

“You can call me Chronicler.”

“I didn’t ask what I could call you,” Kote said. “What is your name?”

“Delva. Delva Lochees.”

Kote stopped polishing the bar and looked up. “Lochees? Are you related to Duchess...” Kote trailed off, nodding to herself. “Yes, of course you are. Not a chronicler, the Chronicler.” She stared hard at the disheveled woman, looking her up and down. “How about that? The great debunker herself.”

Chronicler relaxed slightly, obviously pleased to have her reputation precede her. “I wasn’t trying to be difficult before. I haven’t thought of myself as Delva in years. I left that name behind me long ago.” She gave the innkeeper a significant look. “I expect you know something of that yourself…”

Kote ignored the unspoken question. “I read your book years ago. The Mating Habits of the Common Draccus. Quite the eye-opener for a young woman with her head full of stories.” Looking down she began moving the white cloth along the grain of the bar again. “I’ll admit, I was disappointed to learn that dragons didn’t exist. That’s a hard lesson for a girl to learn.”

Chronicler smiled. “Honestly, I was a little disappointed myself. I went looking for a legend and found a lizard. A fascinating lizard, but a lizard just the same.”

“And now you’re here,” Kote said. “Have you come to prove that I don’t exist?”

Chronicler laughed nervously. “No. You see, we heard a rumor-”

“‘We?’” Kote interrupted.

“I’ve been traveling with an old friend of yours. Skari.”

“Taken you under her wing, has she?” Kote said to herself. “How about that? Skari’s apprentice.”

“More of a colleague, really.”

Kote nodded, still expressionless. “I might have guessed she would be the first to find me. Rumormongers, both of you.”

Chronicler’s smile grew sour, and she swallowed the first words that came to her lips. She struggled for a moment to recapture her calm demeanor.

“So what can I do for you?” Kote set aside the clean linen cloth and gave her best innkeeper’s smile. “Something to eat or drink? A room for the night?”

Chronicler hesitated.

“I have it all right here.” Kote gestured expansively behind the bar. “Old wine, smooth and pale? Honey mead? Dark ale? Sweet fruit liquor! Plum? Cherry? Green apple? Blackberry?” Kote pointed out the bottles in turn. “Come now, surely you must want something?” As she spoke, her smile widened, showing too many teeth for a friendly innkeeper’s grin. At the same time her eyes grew cold, and hard, and angry.

Chronicler dropped her gaze. “I’d thought that-”

“You thought,” Kote said derisively, dropping all pretense of a smile. “I very much doubt it. Otherwise, you might have thought,” she bit off the word, “of how much danger you were putting me in by coming here.”

Chronicler’s face grew red. “I’d heard that Kvoan was fearless,” she said hotly.

The innkeeper shrugged. “Only priests and fools are fearless, and I’ve never been on the best of terms with God.”

Chronicler frowned, aware that she was being baited. “Listen,” she continued calmly, “I was extraordinarily careful. No one except Skari knew I was coming. I didn’t mention you to anyone. I didn’t expect to actually find you.”

“Imagine my relief,” Kote said sarcastically.

Obviously disheartened, Chronicler spoke, “I’ll be the first to admit that my coming here may have been a mistake.” She paused, giving Kote the opportunity to contradict her. Kote didn’t. Chronicler gave a small, tight sigh and continued, “But what’s done is done. Won’t you even consider…”

Kote shook her head. “It was a long time ago-”

“Not even two years,” Chronicler protested.

“-and I am not what I was,” Kote continued without pausing.

“And what was that, exactly?”

“Kvoan,” she said simply, refusing to be drawn any further into an explanation. “Now I am Kote. I tend to my inn. That means beer is three shims and a private room costs copper.” She began polishing the bar again with a fierce intensity. “As you said, ‘done is done.’ The stories will take care of themselves.”

“But-”

Kote looked up, and for a second Chronicler saw past the anger that lay glittering on the surface of her eyes. For a moment she saw the pain underneath, raw and bloody, like a wound too deep for healing. Then Kote looked away and only the anger remained. “What could you possibly offer me that is worth the price of remembering?”

“Everyone thinks you’re dead.”

“You don’t get it, do you?” Kote shook her head, stuck between amusement and exasperation. “That’s the whole point. People don’t look for you when you’re dead. Old enemies don’t try to settle scores. People don’t come asking you for stories,” she said acidly.

Chronicler refused to back down. “Other people say you’re a myth.”

“I am a myth,” Kote said easily, making an extravagant gesture. “A very special kind of myth that creates itself. The best lies about me are the ones I told.”

“They say you never existed,” Chronicler corrected gently.

Kote shrugged nonchalantly, her smile fading an imperceptible amount.

Sensing weakness, Chronicler continued. “Some stories paint you as little more than a red-handed killer.”

“I’m that too.” Kote turned to polish the counter behind the bar. She shrugged again, not as easily as before. “I’ve killed people and things that were worse than people. Every one of them deserved it.”

Chronicler shook her head slowly. “The stories are saying ‘assassin’ not ‘hero.’ Kvoan the Arcane and Kvoan Queenkiller are two very different women.”

Kote stopped polishing the bar and turned her back to the room. She nodded once without looking up.

“Some are even saying that there is a new Chandrian. A fresh terror in the night. Her hair as red as the blood she spills.”

“The important people know the difference,” Kote said as if she were trying to convince herself, but her voice was weary and despairing, without conviction.

Chronicler gave a small laugh . “Certainly. For now. But you of all people should realize how thin the line is between the truth and a compelling lie. Between history and an entertaining story.” Chronicler gave her words a minute to sink in. “You know which will win, given time.”

Kote remained facing the back wall, hands flat on the counter. Her head was bowed slightly, as if a great weight had settled onto her. She did not speak.

Chronicler took an eager step forward, sensing victory. “Some people say there was a lover or yours-”

“What do they know?” Kote’s voice cut like a saw through bone. “What do they know about what happened?” She spoke so softly that Chronicler had to hold her breath to hear.

“They say this lover-” Chronicler’s words stuck in her suddenly dry throat as the room grew unnaturally quiet. Kote stood with her back to the room, a stillness in her body and a terrible silence clenched between her teeth. Her right hand, tangled in a clean white cloth, made a slow fist.

Eight inches away a bottle shattered. The smell of strawberries filled the air alongside the sound of splintering glass. A small noise inside so great a stillness, but it was enough. Enough to break the silence into small, sharp slivers. Chronicler felt herself go cold as she suddenly realized what a dangerous game she was playing. So this is the difference between telling a story and being in one, she thought numbly, the fear.

Kote turned. “What can any of them know?” she asked softly. Chronicler’s breath stopped when she saw Kote’s face. The placid innkeeper’s expression was like a shattered mask. Underneath, Kote’s expression was haunted, eyes half in this world, half elsewhere, remembering.

Chronicler found herself thinking of a story she had heard. One of the many. The story told of how Kvoan had gone looking for her heart’s desire. She had to trick a demon to get it. But once it rested in her hand, she was forced to fight an angel to keep it. I believe it, Chronicler found herself thinking. Before it was just a story, but now I can believe it. This is the face of a woman who has killed an angel.

“What can any of them know about me?” Kote demanded, a numb anger in her voice. “What can they know about any of this?” She made a short, fierce gesture that seemed to take in everything, the broken bottle, the bar, the world.

Chronicler swallowed against the dryness in her throat. “Only what they’re told.”

Tat tat, tat-tat. Liquor from the broken bottle began to patter an irregular rhythm onto the floor. “Ahhhh,” Kote sighed out a long breath. Tat-tat, tat-tat, tat. “Clever. You’d use my own best trick against me. You’d hold my story a hostage.”

“I would tell the truth.”

“Nothing but the truth could break me. What is harder than the truth?” A sickly, mocking smile flickered across her face. For a long moment, only the gentle tapping of drops against the floor kept the silence at bay.

Finally Kote walked through the doorway behind the bar. Chronicler stood awkwardly in the empty room, unsure whether or not she had been dismissed.

A few minutes later Kote returned with a bucket of soapy water. Without looking in the storyteller’s direction, she began to gently, methodically, wash her bottles. One at a time, Kote wiped their bottoms clean of the strawberry wine and set them on the bar between herself and Chronicler, as if they might defend her.

“So you went looking for a myth and found me,” she said without inflection, without looking up. “You’ve heard the stories and now you want the truth of things.”

Radiating relief, Chronicler set her satchel down on one of the tables, surprised at the slight tremor in her hands. “We got wind of you a while back. Just a whisper of a rumor. I didn’t really expect…” Chronicler paused, suddenly awkward. “I thought you would be older.”

“I am,” Kote said. Chronicler looked puzzled, but before she could say anything the innkeeper continued. “What brings you into this worthless little corner of the world?”

“An appointment with the Earl of Baedn-Bryt,” Chronicler said, puffing herself up slightly. “Three days from now, in Treya.”

The innkeeper paused mid-polish. “You expect to make it to the Earl’s manor in four days?” she asked quietly.

“I am behind schedule,” Chronicler admitted. “My horse was stolen near Abbott’s Ford.” She glanced out the window at the darkening sky. “But I’m willing to lose some sleep. I’ll be off in the morning and out of your hair.”

“Well I wouldn’t want to cost you any sleep,” Kote said sarcastically, her eyes gone hard again. “I can tell the whole thing in one breath.” She cleared her throat. “‘I trouped, traveled, loved, lost, trusted and was betrayed.’ Write that down and burn it for all the good it will do you.”

“You needn’t take it that way,” Chronicler said quickly. “We can take the whole night if you like. And a few hours in the morning as well.”

“How gracious,” Kote snapped. “You’ll have me tell my story in an evening? With no time to collect myself? No time to prepare?” Her mouth made a thin line. “No. Go dally with your Earl. I’ll have none of it.”

Chronicler spoke quickly, “If you’re certain you’ll need-”

“Yes.” Kote set a bottle down hard on the bar, hard. “It’s safe to say I’ll need more time than that. And you’ll get none of it tonight. A real story takes time to prepare.”

Chronicler frowned nervously and ran her hands through her hair. “I could spend tomorrow collecting your story…” She trailed off at the sight of Kote shaking her head. After a pause she started again, almost talking to herself. “If I pick up a horse in Baedn, I can give you all day tomorrow, most of the night, and a piece of the following day.” She rubbed her forehead. “I hate riding at night, but-”

“I’ll need three days,” Kote said. “I’m quite sure of it.”

Chronicler blanched. “But…the Earl.”

Kote waved a hand dismissively.

“No one needs three days,” Chronicler said firmly. “I interviewed Olena Velciter. Olena Velciter, mind you. She’s eighty years old, and done two hundred years worth of living. Five hundred, if you count the lies. She sought me out,” Chronicler said with particular emphasis. “She only took two days.”

“That is my offer,” the innkeeper said simply. “I’ll do this properly or not at all.”

“Wait!” Chronicler brightened suddenly. “I’ve been thinking about this all backward,” she said, shaking her head at her own foolishness. “I’ll just visit the Earl, then come back. You can have all the time you like then. I could even bring Skari back with me.”

Kote gave Chronicler a look of profound disdain. “What gives you the slightest impression that I would be here when you came back?” she asked incredulously. “For that matter, what makes you think you’re free to simply walk out of here, knowing what you know?”

Chronicler went very still. “Are-” She swallowed and started again. “Are you saying that-”

“The story will take three days,” Kote interrupted. “Starting tomorrow. That is what I am saying.”

Chronicler closed her eyes and ran her hand over her face. The Earl would be furious, of course. No telling what it might take to get back in his good graces. Still…“If that’s the only way that I can get it, I accept.”

“I’m glad to hear it.” The innkeeper relaxed into a half smile. “Come now, is three days really so unusual?”

Chronicler’s serious expression returned. “Three days is quite unusual. But then again-” Some of the self-importance seemed to leak out of her. “Then again,” she made a gesture as if to show how useless words were. “You are Kvoan.”

The woman who called herself Kote looked up from behind her bottles. A full-lipped smile played about her mouth. A spark was kindling behind her eyes. She seemed taller.

“Yes, I suppose I am,” Kvoan said, and her voice had iron in it.
