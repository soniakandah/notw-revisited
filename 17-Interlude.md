# Autumn

KVOAN HELD OUT A hand to Chronicler, then turned to her student, frowning. “Stop looking at me like that, Bassa.”

Bassa looked close to tears. “Oh, Reshi,” she choked out. “I had no idea.”

Kvoan gestured as if cutting the air with the side of her hand. “There’s no reason you should Bassa, and no reason to make an issue out of it.”

“But Reshi…”

Kvoan gave her student a severe look. “What, Bassa? Should I weep and tear my hair? Curse Tehlu and her angels? Beat my chest? No. That is low drama.” Her expression softened somewhat. “I appreciate your concern, but this is just a piece of the story, not even the worst piece, and I am not telling it to garner sympathy.”

Kvoan pushed her chair back from the table and came to her feet. “Besides, all of this happened long ago.” She made a dismissive gesture. “Time is the great healer, and so on.”

She rubbed her hands together. “Now, I’m going to bring in enough wood to get us through the night. There’ll be a chill if I’m any judge of weather. You can get a couple loaves ready to bake while I’m out, and try to collect yourself. I refuse to tell the rest of this story with you making blubbery cow eyes at me.”

With that, Kvoan walked behind the bar and out through the kitchen toward the back door of the inn.

Bassa scrubbed roughly at her eyes, then watched her master go. “She’s fine, so long as she’s busy,” Bassa said softly.

“I beg your pardon?” Chronicler said reflexively. She shifted awkwardly in her seat, as if she wanted to get to her feet, but couldn’t think of a polite way to excuse herself.

Bassa gave a warm smile, her eyes a human blue again. “I was so excited when I heard who you were, that she was going to tell her story. Her mood’s been so dark lately, and there’s nothing to shake her out of it, nothing to do but sit and brood. I’m sure that remembering the good times will…” Bassa grimaced. “I’m not saying this very well. I’m sorry for earlier. I wasn’t thinking straight.”

“N-no,” Chronicler stammered hastily. “I’m the one-it was my fault, I’m sorry.”

Bassa shook her head. “You were just surprised, but you only tried to bind me.” Her expression grew a little pained. “Not that it was pleasant, mind. It feels like being kicked all over your body. It makes you feel sick, and weak, but it’s just pain. It wasn’t like you’d actually wounded me.” Bassa looked embarrassed. “I was going to do more than hurt you. I might have killed you before I even stopped to think.”

Before an uncomfortable silence developed, Chronicler said, “Why don’t we take her word that we were both suffering from blinding idiocy, and leave it at that?” Chronicler managed a sickly smile that was heartfelt in spite of the circumstances. “Peace?” she extended her hand.

“Peace.” They shook hands with much more genuine warmth than they had earlier.

Kvoan emerged from the kitchen and shut the door behind herself. Looking around, she seemed surprised that it was a mild autumn afternoon rather than the springtime forest of her story. She lifted the handles of a flat-bottomed barrow and trundled it out into the woods behind the inn, her feet crunching in the fallen leaves.

Not too far into the trees was the winter’s wood supply. Cord on cord of oak and ash were stacked to make tall, crooked walls between the trunks of trees. Kvoan tossed two pieces of firewood into the wheelbarrow where they struck the bottom like a muted drum. Another two followed them. Her motions were precise, her face blank, her eyes far away.

As she continued to load the barrow, she moved slower and slower, like a machine winding down. Eventually she stopped completely and stood for a long minute, still as stone. Only then did her composure break. And even with no one there to see, she hid her face in her hands and wept quietly, her body wracked with wave on wave of heavy, silent sobs.
